# Office Complex pt. 22

"Mami's been-" fantastic. She's been *happy*, and she makes *you* happy in a way you'd never even imagined you could be. You like to think you make her just as happy, too. She has friends, people who care about her.

You swallow those words, choking off your instinctive reaction to gush about Mami.

"Mami's been doing well," you say, forcing your tone to something like neutral to match Masami's expression. "Recovering."

Because Masami was Mami's friend, too. Estranged, now, but that just means that feelings are still raw, and hell, if you remember correctly, she *resents* Mami because Mami got her into this life. You'd rather not put your foot into your mouth here - and there's both information and developments she's not aware of, either.

"Recovering from what?" Masami asks sharply. Noriko and Akemi, both in your peripheral awareness, lean back.

"She took the truth about Soul Gems poorly," you say, setting your spoon down to clasp your hands on the table. Unthreatening and unaccusatory. "And the fact that Kyuubey had been *using* her and only pretending to be her friend, even less so."

"Shit, but I-" Masami's mouth shuts with a snap.

"She found out because of me, not you," you say, shaking your head. You blow out a breath, hard. "Kyuubey was *using* her, and I couldn't... I couldn't leave that be."

"Using her?" Hiroko asks.

"To recruit," you say evenly, nodding at Masami.

"That's *bloody* convenient, isn't it?" Masami grunts.

"What happened to you was horrible," you say, steel in your voice. "I'm not trying to discount that, and I don't want to argue with you about it. I'm just telling you what happened, because you asked."

"I was *expecting* you to just say 'she's fine' or something," Masami says, scowling.

Hiroko gives her a sharp, knowing look.

Masami's expression hardens, and she shakes her head. "Fine. Why is she *recovering*?"

And in that one look was an entire ream of information, you imagine. For anyone who could read it, anyway. You're not the one privy to Masami's inner thoughts, but... you can only imagine mixed feelings. She might resent Mami for getting her into this life, maybe even hate her a little - but she wouldn't even have asked if she didn't care at least a little.

"Because realizing the truth about Soul Gems, and about Kyuubey, let her realise what she'd done to every single girl she'd convinced to join us. She..." You trail off, grimacing unhappily and trying to suppress the squirm of guilt. "She didn't take it well."

"Good," Masami mutters.

"*Excuse* me?" you say sharply, attention snapping back to Masami. You sit up, eyes fixed on the redhead.

"I said *good*!" Masami snaps, nostrils flaring. "She *shouldn't*!"

"It *broke* her," you say. Wood creaks faintly. "And she's going to have to live with the guilt for the rest of her life."

"Enough," Hiroko snaps. "Masami, *apologise*."

"I-"

Hiroko cuts her off, hand tightening on hers. "*Masami*."

You can see a muscle jump in the redhead's jaw as she looks up at you.

"I'm sorry for saying that *she* deserves it," Masami grates out.

"I accept your apology," you say. You bite back the impulse to demand *why* she even *asked* if she was just going to denigrate Mami like that - but the more rational part of you knows that she didn't *mean* to get angry. It's not *logical* to poke at a scab, but it's a difficult impulse to resist, too.

"Thank you for inviting us here today, Sabrina," Hiroko says. She smiles at you, dimpling a bit. "But I think it would be best if we left it here for today. How much do we owe you, Miss Watanabe?"

"That would probably be for the best, yes," you agree, standing. "Until next time, Hiroko, Masami."

"Until next time," Hiroko offers.

Noriko and Akemi stand too, adding their farewells, and after Hiroko settles their part of the bill, join you outside the cafe.

"Are you alright, Miss Sabrina?" Akemi asks quietly.

"Yeah, I'm fine," you say. "Why?"

"You seem a bit angry," Noriko says, and hastily adds, "Understandably so, of course."

"I-" you blink, and realise you're shaking, a bit. "Yeah. Just..."

"We understand the anger," Akemi says with a smile. "We're just concerned about you."

"Yeah..." You take a deep breath, and smile. "Yeah, I'm OK. Thank you. Can I offer you a lift home? I should be headed to school about now."

"I think we'll take the scenic route," Akemi says. "But thank you for the offer."

"Alright," you say with a smile. "Thanks for coming out today, and I'm sorry that it ended like that."

"It wasn't your fault," Noriko says with a wan smile. "And it was good to meet them, anyway." She hesitates for a moment. "Do... may we contact them, in the future?"

"Hm?" You give them a faintly puzzled look. "Of course. I'm not in charge of you or anything. You don't need my permission."

"Oh," Noriko says. "Alright."

"We shan't keep you any longer, then," Akemi says. "Bye, Miss Sabrina."

"See you," you say, waving. You watch as the couple walk off, hand in hand with each other, and shake your head as you meander down an unoccupied alley, rapping your knuckles idly on the rough brick of the wall.

That could have gone better. You can't say it was really your fault - Masami *started* it. And maybe you should have been non-committal about Mami, given Masami something vague, but you gave her what she *asked* for.

"*My apologies for that, Sabrina.*" You're already airborne, taking in the cool, clear air, by the time Hiroko's voice sounds in your head.

"*It wasn't your fault,*" you respond with a sigh, inaudible under the boom of your wings.

"*I disagree,*" Hiroko says. "*Masami's in a bit of a... confused position, with regards to Miss Tomoe, and she spoke out of anger. She'll think it through eventually, but right now, she's in no state to. I apologise for her lashing out.*"

"*You're not her keeper,*" you say evenly. "*But for the record, I bear neither of you any animosity. I was angry, myself, but... look, when she calms down, I'm still happy to talk.*"

"*I'll make sure she apologies properly,*" Hiroko says firmly. "*Until then.*"

"*Until then,*" you say, and let the connection close.

The anger ebbs as you wing through the sky, and you sigh again, closing your eyes for a moment. It seems they're still a ways away from a reunion, which is a shame, because... well, Mami needs more friends.

On the other hand, you do have high hopes for Kyouko, so there's that. And speaking of whom...

"*Hey, Kyouko,*" you call. "*We're on for later, yeah?*"

"*Training Wondergirl?*" Kyouko asks. "*Yep.*"

"*Great! See you soon, then,*" you say.

"*Yep,*" Kyouko says, popping the last syllable and ending the connection.

You nod to yourself, banking past the spire of the DBJ building.

That's settled, then, and that's one thing that should go well. Kyouko seems to actually *like* Sayaka, so far. You should probably check in with Nakano Mika at some point, too - she'd done you a huge favour, averting the demolition of Kyouko's father's church. Which Mika had blown off as no big deal, since you'd given her the Clear Seed, but still.

You drift in for a landing in the park outside Mitakihara Middle School, folding your wings and dropping in amongst the dense greenery. You can't help the smile breaking out on your face, either, because even after everything - you're here, and you'll be seeing Mami again soon.

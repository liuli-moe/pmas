# "We Don't Go To Asunaro..." pt. 14

Mami's song comes to an end, her eyes fluttering shut as she holds the last note. Nobody seems to be *breathing*, all eyes on Mami as she finishes. You let out a quiet sigh, and reach out to take her hand under the table.

"Did anyone ever tell you you have an *amazing* singing voice?" Sayaka breathes into the awed silence, eyes wide. She starts clapping enthusiastically, joined an instant later by Madoka and Kazumi and Hitomi and everyone else.

Except you, because you're holding Mami's hand between both of yours, fingers interlaced.

"I... I had a fascination with being an idol when I was younger," Mami admits. "That changed, of course, but..."

"Your voice is gorgeous, Mami," you say warmly, squeezing her hand. She blushes, eyes fluttering as she leans against your side.

A poke at your side is Sayaka handing you the other mike, giving you an expectant smirk.

You'll take that challenge.

You grab the mike, setting it down in front of you so that you can grab the tablet in turn, scrolling through the lists to choose your own song. Yeah, you've got a *song* to live up to. You don't know if you can *sing*, but Madokami damn you if you aren't going to *try* - for Mami's sake, if nothing else.

You could play something with instruments formed of Grief. Play a song that doesn't exist yet. You *could*. But you won't, because what would be the point? You're here to enjoy yourself, to spend time with your friends. You could do it for Mami - she'd love it. She'd love something *you* did for *her*. But you can do that later, in private. Here and now, you're with *friends*. You don't want to show off with your *powers*.

You make your [choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE), and pick up the mike as the song starts to roll from the speakers, upbeat and cheerful. You squeeze Mami's hand, smiling gently at her, and then you start to sing.

You know the words. You don't have to look at the screen, so you let your eyes drift closed. You stop worrying about whether you can sing -turns out you can- and just *do* it. Enthusiasm, yes, but...

This is for Mami.

When the song ends, your eyes open to golden ones, centimeters away from yours, glowing with simple *adoration*. You smile back at Mami, all but humbled by the sheer *depth* of emotion. A faint touch is Mami closing her free hand on top of yours.

"My god, you two," Sayaka mutters. "Madoka, *look* at them. Or maybe don't..."

And *that* ruins the spell. Mami's face flames red, even as everyone starts to clap. You grin at Mami, squeezing her hand gently as Kazumi elbows you in the side. Mami giggles nervously, and squirms a little closer so that she can hide her face against your shoulder. You laugh, wrapping an arm around her.

Even *Hitomi's* beaming, even if she isn't applauding - she can't, not with her wrist still in a cast. *Everyone* else. *Including* Homura, but that might be owed to a helpful nudge from Madoka. She looks faintly amused, though, so you'll take that as an overall win.

"My turn!" Kazumi says, grabbing the mike and tablet control from you. "English songs, English songs... Ah, I know! Kaoru, Umika, sing with me!"

You laugh, sliding the other mike across the table to them as Kazumi starts humming along with the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7y19ED6Vrk). Kaoru makes a rather put-upon face, but obligingly provides the wordless backup chorus, Umika leaning closer so they can both sing into the microphone.

Kazumi's... enthusiasm hasn't ebbed, certainly. Oddly enough, she sings somewhat better in English than in Japanese.

You start serving up lemonade as you listen, sliding glasses of lemonade across the table to everyone before claiming one for yourself. You're getting thirsty, anyway.

Sayaka takes the next song, another English one since it's apparently English song hour now. You can't help but twitch and give her slightly perplexed looks at her song choice. Heaven is a Place on Earth, indeed.

Sayaka belts [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOGEyBeoBGM) out with a considerable amount of energy. You... were kind of sort of mostly joking before, but she is giving a *suspicious* number of hints about angels and heaven and whatnot.

... If she's been an angel of the Law of Cycles this entire time you're going to *murder* her.

... She *can't* be.

... Right?

... You're going to *kill* her if she is. She'd be an angel, anyway, she can take it.

You nod firmly to yourself and turn your attention to more pleasant things, like cuddling Mami. She gives you a concerned look. You shake your head, smiling - it's nothing important now. Instead, you pull her closer, starting to bob your head to the rhythm of the music. Mami giggles faintly, swaying along with you.

Madoka takes the next song, shy and a little timid, but there's nothing wrong with her singing, certainly.

"Homura? Would you like to sing a song?" you ask as Madoka's song ends. You continue in telepathy. "*You don't have to, if you don't want to.*"

Homura takes a convulsive swallow of lemonade. "I'd rather not," she mumbles.

"Aw," Sayaka says, halfway through passing the mike.

"That's fine," you say, smiling. "It's good that you're here, anyway!"

"I think you'd sound really good!" Kazumi notes, perking up. "You have a beautiful voice."

Homura shrugs. Kazumi pouts, but subsides to a consoling pat from Kaoru.

The rest of the karaoke session rolls on. Not to be outdone by Kazumi, you sing a duet with Mami, both of you with your mikes and swaying to the rhythm. You almost feel inadequate next to Mami's singing, truth be told. She's *amazing*.

Eventually, though, it's time to go. You knock back the last of your lemonade, beaming around at everyone as you all get up and start stretching.

"Thanks for coming, everyone," you say. "I had a lot of fun."

"Yeah, me too!" Sayaka cheers, to an enthusiastic round of agreement from everyone. Mami takes your hand, squeezing gently.

You grin at her, and then Homura. You reach out by telepathy as everyone starts to file out of the room - Homura's sticking close to Madoka. "*Hey, Homura? Thank you for coming. You didn't have to.*"

"*It was... good to hang out,*" Homura says, soft and uncertain, almost vulnerable.

You grin at her again, and nod as you all head out of the karaoke parlour and out of the shopping centre, into the fresh evening air. The drone of the city fills your ears, rumbling herds of pedestrians and cars thronging the streets under sunlight shading rapidly towards orange.

"So I guess this is where we all split up?" you ask.

"Yup!" Sayaka says. "We're still on for the Witch hunt after dinner? And homework after that?"

You glance at Mami and Kazumi, receiving nods in return. "Yup! Madoka, Hitomi?"

"Ah, yes! Definitely! Um... If Hitomi is fine with it?" Madoka asks. "Um, Homura, are you coming?"

"If it's OK," Homura murmurs.

"Of course!" Hitomi says, smiling. "I'll see you all after dinner."

"Ah, are you taking the bus?" Sayaka asks. "I'll come with you."

"Sayaka, you really don't have to," Hitomi says, making a face.

"It's no problem," Sayaka insists. "We don't live that far apart anyway, now."

Hitomi sighs, not protesting any further.

"Shall we get going?" you suggest, waving down the road.

You bid Homura and Madoka farewell for now -they're headed in the other direction- and start heading home with Kazumi and her friends in tow. Hitomi and Sayaka are headed in the same direction for now, too, which... gives you an opportunity. You give Mami a quick smile, letting her hand go and murmuring a warm, "I'll be back."

You drift across the group over to Sayaka. "So I had a thought," you say, pitching your voice low so as not to draw attention.

"Mm?" Sayaka says, grunting as she hefts the two schoolbags higher on her shoulder.

"Well..." you suck in a breath, and grin at her. Might as well channel *Kirika* for this one - you're not sure anyone you know has her beat for romantic advice. Maybe Madoka's parents. "This is advice *I* got from someone. Confessing takes *courage*, no matter what kind of personality you have. In the end, it's really just down to being brave and *doing* it."

Sayaka flushes a deep crimson red, ducking her face to hide it. You glance at Mami and Hitomi and the Asunaro girls - Mami glances over, beaming at you, but no one seems to notice Sayaka's reaction. You angle your body a little so that she's harder to spot, anyway. Your height has its uses, sometimes.

"I-" Sayaka squeaks.

You snicker. "Weren't you going to see Kwijibo today, anyway?"

"I-" Sayaka manages to turn a little redder. "I was thinking about it but I got *nervous*."

"Hah," you say, swallowing a giggle. "Honestly, given that it's him... you might as well be extra-blunt and just ask him out on a date."

Sayaka makes a weird, choked noise, and shakes her head.

"Not gonna force you into it," you say, clapping her shoulder. "But do think about it."

You stick with Sayaka for a few more minutes, giving her time for her blush to fade before returning to Mami's side and taking her hand. She interlaces her fingers with you, turning to give you a warm smile.

The walk home is spent in chatter, Hitomi and Sayaka stopping at a bus stop. You *could* take to the rooftops after that, but you don't - you just walk, and talk, weaving through the noisy crowds. Mami's almost glowing, happy and content as you finally make it back.

You unlock the door, removing your shoes as you step inside. "I'm home," you murmur.

"Welcome home," Mami answers, beaming at you as she follows you in. "Please, come in! Make yourselves at home."

"Ah, it's just like I remember!" Kazumi says, looking around the maisonette. "Oh! That rug is new!"

Mami smiles, shaking her head. "I haven't changed much," she says. "Um, you'll be staying in the guest room for now, if that's alright?"

Kazumi's eyebrow goes up. "There's still just the one guest room, right?"

Her question is followed by Umika and Kaoru's eyebrows going up, too.

"Yup," you confirm, looping your arm through Mami's elbow.

"I see!" Kazumi says brightly.

"Ah- we should start cooking dinner!" Mami says, tugging you towards the kitchen.

"I'll help\~!" Kazumi says.

"No, no, we wouldn't feel comfortable letting you help," you say, waving your hands. "You're our guests, after all!"

"Aw," Kazumi pouts. "Mami?"

"Sabrina's right," Mami says, blush fading as she smiles. "You're our guests."

# Office Complex pt. 15

Mami squeezes your hand gently, and you can catch the concerned look she shoots you out of the corner of her eye. Heh. Guess she knows you pretty well, at this point.

Still, your attention is fixed mainly on Homura and Sayaka, your jaw working silently as you look between them. They're in *agreement* with each other, Homura looking as surprised as you feel.

"I..." You shake your head. "Y'know what? Yeah. If you both think it's for the best, I can't really argue. I don't... I don't really like keeping secrets, but if you think that it's for the best, we'll do it your way."

"We'll tell her eventually, right?" Mami says - inflected like a question, but sounding more like a statement.

"Yeah!" Sayaka says, eyeing you. "I mean... I've known Madoka since we were kids, you know? So I *know* telling her *now* just means she's going to worry herself to sleep for the next two weeks. I *suppose* telling her that we're gonna go stop Iowa makes it better, but then she'd just worry about *us* instead. Telling her after... She'll be a bit upset, yeah, but she'll get it."

"And Hitomi?" Mami asks.

"Uh. Honestly, Hitomi..." Sayaka blinks. "Hey, hang on a sec. You're having dinner with her parents like... tomorrow, right? To, er, read them in properly on magic and all that? Tell *them*, maybe?"

"That... is an excellent point," you admit. "Yeah, I can think about that."

"Hey, on that note, are you gonna tell Madoka's parents?" Sayaka asks. She waves her hands vaguely in the air. "Only fair, right?"

"I... hm," you say, glancing at Homura. No help forthcoming there. "It's a good point too, and I'll see what I can figure out?"

Sayaka shrugs, and slouches back against the wall.

"The Shizukis might be able to offer advice, or help," Mami notes.

"*Everyone's* making fantastic points today," you say with a laugh, catching Homura's eye again. It's something you'll need to discuss with her, regardless. "Yeah, I agree. It's possibly something to check with them."

"So what's gonna happen now?" Sayaka asks. "Uh... Not *literally* now, but with Iowa and everything."

"I'm going to gather more information," you say firmly. "After... you know, Rionna, I want more details before I decide to act on Iowa based on just hearsay. But *when* I figure out what they're actually like, then I'll let you all know?"

"That sounds good," Mami says, squeezing your hand gently.

"Count me in," Sayaka says with a firm nod. She grins. "See, this is more like it. A brave band of magical girls against the forces of evil of the world. Don't you roll your eyes at me, Homura."

You snort, grinning at Sayaka.

"Anyway. That's what I wanted you all to know - anything you guys wanna bring up?" you say.

"Nah," Sayaka says, shaking her head. "Thanks for letting me know."

"Thank Homura - I didn't think of it at first and she was the one to bring it up, actually," you say, and grin sheepishly. "Just... yeah."

"Ouch," Sayaka says. "Ouch, Sabrina. I bet you thought of Mami, huh."

"Well... yeah," you say. Is your face red? Your face is definitely red. The situation is a bit more complicated than that, with Homura's opinions, but you *do* deserve a bit of the shaming there.

Sayak sniffs haughtily. "Well, I see how it is," she says. "But *you*, Homura. Thanks for sticking up for me."

Homura shrugs, and pivots on a heel, starting to head back down the corridor - which, of course, obliges you all to follow her. Sayaka slugs you lightly on the shoulder as you pass her, grinning playfully at you, and you slug her back.

You drop off Sayaka, Homura offering quietly muttered adjustments to help her reposition herself, and then back upstairs to drop Mami off.

She takes a deep breath and goes up on her tiptoes to kiss you gently on the cheek. "I'll... I'll see you later?"

You wink at her, smiling broadly and closing your arms around her. "You will. I promised you not even ten minutes ago\~"

"Until then, then," Mami says, taking a deep breath and stepping back from the hug. She smiles at Homura. "Sayaka was right. Your power *is* strange, but it's audacious and it suits you."

"... Thank you?" Homura says, shifting uncertainly. She motions towards a spot. "Stand here."

"Alright," Mami says. Her smile is tinged somewhat with nervousness, now, and you give her a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder before moving over to clasp Homura's wrist gently.

"Arm out a bit more, left leg up," Homura murmurs. "Doesn't need to be perfect, just not noticeably different from your original position."

Mami follows Homura's quiet adjustments, and with one last smile from you, releases the ribbon. You turn to Homura, trying not to dwell on the way the colour, the vibrant *life* drains out of Mami. It's just Homura's power, as discomfiting as it looks.

"Shall we get going?" you ask. "And, um... thank you for indulging me, and being willing to bring everyone in."

"It's fine," Homura mutters, starting to head back towards the stairs. "This... it was necessary for everyone to know."

"Yeah," you say. "Still, I could have found another way or time, and... look, just accept the thanks, Homura."

Homura shrugs slightly.

"And, uh... just to clarify," you say. "Telling the Kanames... I think Sayaka has a point, and I think that at a later time we may want to give it serious consideration. I mean, Madoka loves her parents, and respects them. But it's something to be *discussed*, and not something that'll happen without your approval, yeah?"

"... thank you," Homura says.

You grin at her, and let the conversation lapse. Homura needs the reassurance, you feel. She doesn't need *coddling*, but that diamond-hard facade is, ultimately, a shell grown in response to trauma. At the end, she's just as much a scared, traumatized girl, and... it doesn't hurt to reinforce that you want to *help*. You want her to be *happy*.

Homura brings you up to the roof, turning to face you.

"Nah," you say with a grin, interpreting the questioning look as, well, a question. "No 'one more thing' this time, I'm afraid. I know I've got a bad habit of doing that, but not this time!"

"... until later, then," Homura says. Her grip loosens on your wrist.

"See you!" you say cheerfully, and deliberately step back, out of her gras-

-p. Homura's gone by the time you reorient, the noise of the city and on the school beneath your feet rolling over you. And also some angry squawking, accompanied by an angry bird doing an equally angry, hopping dance around your feet with his feathers all fluffed up.

"*Sabrina?*" Mami's voice sounds inside your head as you bend over to offer your hand to Mugin and soothe him. Apparently birds -or Mugin in particular, anyway- can and do notice the displacement from timestop.

"*Hey, Mami,*" you say warmly. "*How are you?*"

"*Better now,*" she responds. "*I'm sorry, I just... wanted to make sure you were alright.*"

"*I'm perfectly fine, about to head home for a bit to use the computer,*" you say. You wince a little as Mugin claws his way up your arm to perch on your shoulder. "*And don't apologise for that! Otherwise I'm going to start up an apology jar. Like a swear jar, but for unnecessary apologising.*"

"*We'd have it filled within the week,*" Mami says, slight emphasis on the first word. Her voice softens. "*What are you headed home for?*"

"*I'm gonna check in on the IRCs,*" you tell Mami. "*I'm hoping that the American one in particular would have some insights about the Iowa group.*"

"*Ah, that does make sense, but America is huge,*" Mami observes. "*The Iowa group might be famous, but they might not have specific knowledge...*"

"*Every little bit helps,*" you say, standing. Grief boils forth from your shoulders, drawn from your extradimensional storage to form your wings - and Mugin, standing proud in place of honour on your shoulder, seems only mildly perturbed. "*I'm just gathering up every scrap of info I can get to see what I can piece together out of it, anyway.*"

"*Ah, that does make sense,*" Mami says.

"*Did you make it to class alright?*" you ask. Wings fully formed, you crouch, and glance aside at Mugin. "Hang on to your feathers."

"*I did!*" Mami says. "*Class will be starting soon - it's literature now.*"

"*Ew, lit right after lunch?*" you ask as you launch yourself into the air, wincing at Mugin's cawing *right into your ear* and also his talons digging through your shirt and into your skin. "*Won't half the class be asleep?*"

"*Ours not to reason why,*" Mami says solemnly. "*You know, nobody truly knows who schedules the classes - the timetable changes every week, did you know? I've always thought it might be some Witch that somehow got into the school systems...*"

You can't help the laugh the bubbles up your chest and over telepathy. "*Noooo that can't possibly be true,*" you say as you soar past the glittering spires of Mitakihara city. "*No Witch would possibly dare to mess with the mighty Tomoe Mami.*"

"*Maybe a very *small* Witch that snuck into the school?*" Mami says. "*Trying to drive students into despair with nonsensical and poorly planned lesson schedules.*"

"*Well, then, it is our *duty* to hunt it down!*" you declare, nearly overbalancing as you thrust one finger skyward. Mugin squawks in protest, scrambling off your shoulder and onto your back between your shoulderblades.

"*Our solemn duty,*" Mami agrees. "*For we have sworn great oaths to protect those who are weak, to help those who need it, to punish those who deserve it.*"

"*In the name of the moon?*" you add, grinning.

Mami chokes back a giggle. "*I'm in class, Sabrina!*"

You laugh, always pleased to be able to make Mami laugh. And so you relax and chat with Mami as you head back *home*. It comes easily, just letting the gentle teasing and commentary flow between the two of you.

Still, Mami eventually has to concentrate on her class, and so you end the conversation as you descend the stairs. You hum cheerfully to yourself as you reach the doors... and then pause, turning towards the lift. You should have mail due in, shouldn't you?

The mailboxes are down on the ground floor, so down you go, soothing Mugin as the lift door closes. Enclosed spaces and wild birds don't mix, it turns out, but you make it down, anyway.

As it turns out, you *do* have mail, a slim package wrapped in non-descript brown paper. Which you don't believe any government would *ever* do for sending important documents like, say, a passport. But then, this package didn't come from the government, now did it?

You head back up the stairs at a jaunty climb, making it back up to unlock the doors and shed socks and shoes alike. You can't help but smile as you take in the familiar sight of home, emptier in more ways than one without Mami, but you don't exactly begrudge that.

Mugin hops off your shoulder as you head towards the study, and you give it a stern look.

"Sayaka had better have explained house training to you," you say, and you should have thought about that before bringing Mugin back. Then again, he didn't leave any messes when you were over at Yuki's place, either, so maybe she did.

Mami's computer clicks on without fuss, running through the bootup as you tear open the package. A card and a passport fall out, and you check the latter to find your own face beaming out from the page. And as it turns out, the card is 'your' resident registration card.

"*Hey, Miss Inoue?*" you call across telepathy, because it'd be polite to update Yuuki. The card you pocket, the passport... you'll ask where Mami keeps hers and keep it together. "*I got the package!*"

"*Sec, sorry,*" Yuuki responds, sounding faintly distracted.

You fall silent, raising your eyebrows.

"*Right, sorry,*" Yuuki says after a minute. "*Team is fucking inting. Anyway, yeah. Good! Everything in order?*"

"*Yeah, it's perfect,*" you say. She's playing... League, probably. "*Again, thank you - and thank you for getting it to me this *quick*. Seriously, I wouldn't have expected it until like next week at best.*"

"*I'm the best at what I do,*" Yuuki says. You can hear the smug pride in her voice. "*It wasn't a problem.*"

"*Well, sincerely, thanks,*" you say. "*All the best in your game?*"

"*Don't need it,*" Yuuki says. "*Later!*"

You laugh to yourself at the abrupt cut-off and turn your attention back to Mami's computer, fingers flying over the keyboard. Nyantokanyaru first, you think.

You squint at the screen, slightly concerned. You *do* hope you didn't step into something, though you were just making inferences from certain anime references and the username Hatsumi -Hatsumi Nodoka, you think?- was using last time. Who seems to be notably missing this time, you can't help but notice.

You purse your lips slightly. On the one hand, you want to be friendly - you want to be *friends*, as you said. On the other hand, you can't help but remember how *skittish* Nodoka seemed to be around you the last time you actually talked to her. You can't really blame her, you suppose, but you wouldn't be surprised if it were a little white lie.

It's a bit of a hail Mary, really. A bit of a hail Mami? You *know* that Mami has a reputation for being a do-gooder, and hopefully that could offer them a bit more reassurance in your intentions. Also, if you conquered the world for *Empress* Mami, you would definitely have reason to hail Mami.

Hail Satan? No, the complete opposite of what you're interested in. Besides, there's a certain furry Satan you don't want to invoke. Hail *Santa*, now that has possibilities.

... given magical girls, you're not entirely sure Santa *doesn't* exist in some way or another. And come to think of it, Santa would be very familiar with hail, what with the winter seasonal theme.

What were you thinking about again? Ah, yes, hail Mami.

You drum your fingers beside the keyboard, watching the screen as you wait for a response. They're discussing it offline, you're presuming, and you don't blame them in the slightest. You *really* hope you're not coming on too strong here, but you also don't really know how else you can convey your sincerity.

Cake is such a small thing, and offering something as minor as *convenience* is the least you can do to establish that you mean *well*. Besides, if there's a place that does good cake, that's somewhere you could possibly bring Mami. Though you're sure that Mami's cake is better, anyway.

You sit back, frowning at the screen as you consider your mental timetable. You honestly can't think of anything scheduled for Tuesday, though Oriko predicted the Soujo's *likely* arrival for Monday. That's really your only concern, you think.

**\[] Confirm meeting for Tuesday?
\- \[] Propose another day?
\- \[] Any other topics to cover?
\[x] Vote in abeyance
\- \[] Any particular topics to hit with #milesgloriosus?**

Spoiler: Vote in abeyance

-\[X] Also log into #milesgloriosus to hang out a bit and chat. Nothing heavy, just get to know them more.
\[X] While on IRC, confirm meeting times today with:
-\[X] The Shiogama Refugees. (To check their mental health, warn about the Soujus, and check their witchbomb status).
-\[X] Oriko and Kirika. (To check on Oriko's soul, and update them about Tokyo Politics and the Iowa situation).
\[X] Contact the Animators, let them know about the Soujus.

Right. Slightly later than I'd like, but better late than never?

Unrelated, fun tidbit: did you know that I actually wrote a short script Python to help me populate IRC timestamps? ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# Office Complex pt. 17

"*Sabrina?*" Oriko prompts, a hint of concern entering her voice.

"*Hm? What's wrong?*" you say, blinking and refocusing.

"*Nothing on our end - *you* trailed off,*" Oriko says.

"*Ah, sorry. Just thinking a bit,*" you say. "*Anyway, yeah. As I said, I'll visit, and sooner rather than later. I'd visit *now*, but I've already got things scheduled that I need to head off for.*"

"*That's perfectly understandable,*" Oriko says, and hesitates for a second. "*To be clear, I am not attempting to pressure you - as far as you know, Iowa won't arrive here soon, so we have time, do we not?*"

"*We do,*" you confirm.

"*Then all I request is that I be kept in the loop,*" Oriko says.

"I'm *putting pressure on,*" Kirika chirps. "*Daaaaate!*"

"*Yeah, I know,*" you say. "*I'll work it out, I promise.*"

"*I'll hold you to it!*" Kirika says.

"*I will, I think, test my new powers,*" Oriko says. "*I shall see if I am able to spy on the Iowa girls. I doubt I will succeed, given how little link to them I have to start with and my inexperience, but I think it would be a good exercise.*"

"*... actually, yeah, that *does* sound like a good idea,*" you say, blinking at the screen. You're not *really* paying attention to the IRC now, more on talking to Oriko and Kirika. "*I mean... well, um. I'll have to let Homura know - I promised to keep her informed about developments with you. Sayaka and Hitomi, too.*"

It's not like you can't pay attention to both, but it doesn't feel polite, and you're just hanging out on the IRC, anyway.

"*I understand,*" Oriko says simply. "*I appreciate your efforts in shielding us from their ire.*"

"*Yeah, well... you're my friends now,*" you say. "*No arguing.*"

"*Every moment more I can spend with Kirika is something I'm grateful for, Sabrina,*" Oriko says. "*So thank you.*"

"*Same,*" Kirika says, heartfelt.

"*Better plan long term,*" you say, jabbing your finger at the wall. No, wait, Oriko's house is *that* way. You spin on your chair and point accusingly at the other wall. "*You got that?*"

Oriko chuckles quietly over telepathy, amusement leaking into her voice as she responds. "*Noted, Sabrina. Long term plans *are* my specialty, after all.*"

You pause, your face probably making a rather *complicated* expression. Oh, wait, you've got the perfect response lined up.

"*Kirika? Squirtbottle,*" you say, your eyes narrowing at the wall. "*Please and thank you.*"

"*Got iiiit\~*" Kirika chirps.

Oriko sighs pointedly at you. "*I blame you, Sabrina.*"

"*Happily,*" you say, grinning. "*Anyway. One last thing, then I'll leave you to it - consider learning how to lipread? Might be a useful thing, with your clairvoyance.*"

"*True enough. I'll make a note for it when I'm not fending off* my own girlfriend," Oriko says accusingly. "*Until next time, Sabrina.*"

"*Later!*" Kirika says.

"*See you!*" you say, snickering to yourself as you hang up. Alright. Things seem to be developing apace there, then.

You snicker, grinning. This is oddly comfortable, in many ways. You let the chatter flow, your fingers dancing over the keyboard as you mentally reach out for another conversation.

"*Miss Watanabe, Miss Saito? Do you have a few moments free right now?*" you ask. You *did* promise that you'd be meeting the Shiogama girls after lunch, after all.

> \[13:23:58] \<GriefBeGone> so I'm just curious
> \[13:24:08] \<GriefBeGone> What's everyone's powers, anyway, if you don't mind my asking?

> \[13:25:34] \<EleseCanGoDie> that's just because they were lazy and didn't want to show up gandalf
> \[13:25:35] \<GriefBeGone> Ah
> \[13:25:49] \<GriefBeGone> they didn't want to make him feel bad after he fell to his death

> \[13:25:56] \<Genesis> \*sort\* of death
> \[13:26:22] \<Fireblade> Yep, they let him fall after the Balrog because they knew Gandalf wanted the most metal death scene possible. A real tragedy.

"*Ah! Miss Vee?*" It takes the Shiogama girls a few minutes to respond, Noriko's voice sounding in your mind. "*Apologies, are you coming over now?*"

"*Not *right* this moment, but soon,*" you say. "*And... OK, there are a couple of things I wanna cover, but first of all - I was wondering if you'd want to meet somewhere else, and if you'd like to meet the other magical girls in Mitakihara? Those are two questions, by the way, since I haven't actually confirmed the latter bit with, y'know, the girls in question.*"

"*... certainly?*" Noriko says.

"*The other magical girls in Mitakihara?*" Akemi echoes, curiosity leaking into her voice.

"*Yeah, and I realise that I never really went into proper detail before. Which I should fix!*" you say. "*Gaikotsu Masami and Wakahisa Hiroko, and the former is an... estranged student of Mami's. Ah, and Megane Ono, teeechnically.*"

"*We would be happy to meet them?*" Noriko says, sounding faintly confused.

You chuckle quietly. "*It's a bit complicated,*" you admit. "*I... well, honestly, there's a fair bit of stuff to go over that I think you need to hear, so... maybe we can meet somewhere, I'll ferry you over to meet the Animators, and we'll all talk? Only if you're feeling up to it, of course.*"

"*Um... we are,*" Noriko says. "*Whereabouts?*"

"*I could just pick you up from the apartment, if you like? Or if you know of any cafe or something you'd like to try, I'd be happy to meet there, too?*" you offer.

"*A pickup would be easiest, if that's OK?*" Noriko ventures.

"*Alright. I'll let you know when I'm heading over - and I don't know if the Animators will be up for the meeting, but there's a couple things I need to discuss with you regardless,*" you say, smiling at the wall. "*So... see you soon?*"

"*See you,*" Noriko says, Akemi echoing the farewell before ending the connection.

You hum thoughtfully to yourself. With that meeting sorted out, the next task, clearly, is to check that the *other* half of the joint meeting's up for it. And it does rather feel like a long time since you've met the Animators face-to-face, let alone Megane Ono.

> \[13:28:13] \<NotANickname> so what's japan like, anyway?
> \[13:28:16] \<GriefBeGone> Japan is lovely!
> \[13:28:29] \<TomatoPotato> how long have you been waitjing to ask that
> \[13:28:31] \<NotANickname> shush you
> \[13:28:36] \<TomatoPotato> (NAN loves her some anime)
> \[13:28:38] \<NotANickname> SHUSH you
> \[13:28:43] \<GriefBeGone> Nothing wrong with that!
> \[13:28:57] \<GriefBeGone> I feel like I'd enjoy anime if I actually had time to watch any, honestly
> \[13:29:01] \<TomatoPotato> lol fair enough
> \[13:29:09] \<NotANickname> have you ever been to akiba?
> \[13:29:35] \<GriefBeGone> Akihabara? Nope, but I \*am\* going to go meet the Tokyo Council soonish, so that might change
> \[13:29:39] \<NotANickname> Tokyo Council?
> \[13:29:57] \<Fireblade> The MG organization controlling Tokyo, from what I've heard.
> \[13:30:01] \<GriefBeGone> Yeah, exactly
> \[13:30:05] \<NotANickname> god I wish I could go

"*Hey Masami, Hiroko, got a second and possibly half an hour or so?*" you say, starting yet *another* telepathic conversation.

"*Sabrina? What's up?*" Masami asks.

"*Uh... well, I have some news I should update you with, and there's also an opportunity for you to meet the new girls in town if you feel up to a small meeting?*" you say. "*The two girls from Shiogama.*"

"*News?*" Masami asks, her voice overlapping with Hiroko's: "*Shiogama?*"

"*Um. Well, it's not my place to go into the details, but basically? Their old group fell apart, and they needed a place to stay,*" you say. "*And yeah. Politics, and incoming.*"

"*That's kind of you,*" Hiroko says.

"*Weeelll... we should be good for a meeting,*" Masami says. "*Do you have a particular meeting place in mind? And do you want us to grab Ono?*"

\=====​

Have an earlier update this week!

So, an aside: The sequence of events, unless specifically voted against, will be wrapping up the IRC chat, a meeting with the Shiogama girls, including the private discussion about the Witchbomb (vote points will be presented as appropriate), and then ferrying them over to meet the Animators.

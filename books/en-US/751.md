# Lowlife pt. 17

Just as you're about to reconfigure the chairs back into the neat rows for flight, Homura stirs, amethyst eyes flickering about the group. You pause, smiling at her and waiting patiently for her to speak.

"Sabrina, Miss Nakano," she says. "How much effort would it be to place a third flight platform ahead of us?"

"Uh... virtually none on my part, and I can cover any costs in Grief if it's a problem, Miss Nakano?" you say, glancing to the wind mage.

"I can do it as long as it's not too far ahead, sure," Mika says. "Already handling the bear platform. Why?"

"Advance warning," Homura says, gaze shifting over to Sayaka. "A clone with the vision power."

Sayaka stares at Homura for a second, and then slams the palm of her hand into her forehead hard enough to knock her head back. "*Ow*. Can't believe I didn't think of that."

Kyouko crunches a mouthful of potato chips, obnoxiously and pointedly loud.

"... That's *genius*," you say, resisting the urge to face-palm yourself. Sayaka put enough force into hers to cover your share, anyway. "Heck, I can't believe that didn't occur to me, either."

Yuki chuckles quietly.

"And therein lies the value of allies, no?" she says, smirking faintly.

"Yeah, but I should have thought of it," Sayaka grumps as she sorts through her chain of powers. "Got it. Ready when you are, Sabrina."

You put the clone onto its own platform, bubbling it down through the floor and guiding it out front. Sayaka gives you a thumbsup as you feel the winds pick up around Mika, twisting to suit the new configuration - and speaking of configurations, it's time to shift the chairs back into flight position.

"I wanna spinny chair!" Kirika demands as the chairs shuffle around.

"Ooooh, that's an option?" Kazumi says. "I wanna spinny chair too!"

"... you know what, sure," you say. You make sure to add frictionless bearings, too, and proceed to ignore the twin 'wheeeee's coming from behind you.

Mami squeezes your hand gently, giving you a warm, reassuring smile. You grin back at her, and nod in answer to her unspoken question - yeah, you *do* feel better about this, now. You're still worried, but that's part and parcel of the entire affair. You tilt your head slightly, directing a questioning look her way. She purses her lips slightly, evidently considering it before smiling a little wider and tipping her chin a hair to the side, indicating the rest of your friends behind you, and then tucking her head against your shoulder with a content little sigh.

You huff quietly, amused. Mami's a *bit* worried, but not *that* worried - not with the support of everyone, and not with *you* here. In retrospect, you really should have expected that response.

"Alright. Seatbelts, everyone!" you call happily.

"What seatbelts?" Kaoru asks.

"Metaphorical seatbelts, though I can actualize them if you want," you offer.

"Do we *need* them?" Sasami asks, archly amused.

"Dun- actually, yes," you say. "No *violent* stops, unless there's a surprise mountain that I don't want to demolish or something, but we're going to be accelerating and decelerating hard for the entire journey, so we'll need something to keep us in our seats."

"Mountain demolitions don't sound too likely," Sasami says after a moment, apparently having given the notion sober and entirely serious consideration. "So I think I'm good with the lack of seatbelts."

Three-point seatbelts, still. Simple enough to add, even if not everyone deigns to put them on at the moment, then they can't say you didn't warn them.

"Alright. Here we go, everyone!" you say.

And you're off. Acceleration slams you back into your seats, the somewhat-exorable forces of physics taking over. You ignore, of course, the surprised squeaking noise that is Kirika being dumped onto Oriko's seat by virtue of a rotating chair, not putting on her seatbelt, and the acceleration - you could have prevented that, but why would you? You're not even sure Kirika or Oriko would thank you if you had.

Of course, you're all magical girls. Acceleration, once you get used to it, is just one more law of physics to treat as a polite, if insistent suggestion. Well, sort of, anyway. You can *move*, but you're always conscious of the enormous force pressing you back.

It makes sense, you suppose. Given the sheer *variety* of Witch barriers, you wouldn't be surprised at all by one that played with gravity or such - and superhuman strength is part and parcel of being a magical girl, anyway. That said, with little to discuss, you opt to just wrap your arm around Mami and relax for the moment.

The shortest distance between two points would be a straight line, but since you have little interest in tunnelling through the horizon -no surprise mountain demolitions!- the shortest distance is the curve of the planet. But then, the shortest *distance* isn't the shortest *time* to travel when you can accelerate the whole way, and so: brachistochrone curve.

The temperature plunges as you soar through the skies, so you seal the flight platform the rest of the way up and start vibrating the walls to heat the air. You don't seal up Mika's window, of course, but then, you need the ventilation, and she seems to enjoy the freezing cold *anyway*. On the other hand, Kazumi uses the cold as an excuse to snuggle closer to Umika and Kaoru, and nudge Mirai into flopping across their laps. So too does Yuma cuddle closer to Kyouko, nervous and fidgety.

You arc over Japan, and then across the sea. It's a beautifully clear day, this far out, the seas a frozen glitter rolling past - glittering not because of the ripple of waves, but because of your speed as you blur past. Ships and fishing boats dot the endless expanse in distant specks and rippling wakes of white, almost invisible from above.

You're high enough to see the horizon curve away, any detail that you might spot hazing away into the fuzz of distance and greys of timestop. There's the Russian coast, and there's an uncertain smudge that might be a certain naval base, and there's the Korean peninsula.

Mami stirs a little, tilting her head back to peer up at your face.

"Mm?" you hum.

"It's been a long time since I've been this far from home," Mami says, after a moment. Speaking isn't *easy*, against the crush of acceleration, but it's manageable - and Mami pitches her voice just loud enough for you to hear, her breath tickling your cheeks. "It's beautiful, from up here."

"Really?" you say, blinking.

"Which?" Mami says, a hint of a smile playing about her lips.

"Both?" you say.

"Well... both are true," Mami says. She giggles softly. "But... I haven't left Mitakihara much, especially not... since I became a magical girl."

"That's clearly not acceptable," you say with a faint smile. "Happily, it's something that I can change." You've *definitely* thought about bringing Mami somewhere nice - Paris, say. Or the Moon.

Mami smiles, and returns to leaning against you.

Korea gets left behind, in favour of more seas, and then... China. Vast farms, vast cities, vast forests. Nanjing rivals Mitakihara, perhaps even eclipses it in size, glittering skyscrapers that are mere specks that you have to strain to pick out from this high up. Clouds scud past in great, drifting packs, rain here, clear skies there... it all blurs together.

Homura's been holding up without visible signs of strain, the Grief trickling into her Soul Gem at a steady rate. You owe her a hug later, at the very least - she might claim she's doing this for pragmatic reasons, but those reasons include the fact that you asked for help. You owe her the *biggest* hug.

"Turnaround point, everyone!" you warn. "If you're not wearing the seatbelts, then now's the time - or hold onto someone who is, or we're going to have to do some rearrangement of seats."

Turnaround. Deceleration tries to throw you *forward* now as you blast over inland China. More cities, more fields, endless roads and railways and rivers streaking across the landscape, rolling hills turning into vast mountain ranges. Snow-capped peaks far to your right, the eastern edge of the Himalayan uplift... you're pretty sure you're over Yunnan proper, now, approaching the border.

Mami nudges your elbow gently, pointing just a hair to the right. You smile, and redirect your flightpath ever so slightly in that direction, a slow banking turn until Mami nods firmly. A minor course correction, all things considered, but then, you're still a few hundred kilometers out, you think.

It doesn't feel like a few hundred kilometers is a long distance. Not at all. Your nerves ratchet tighter as you continue to slow, despite everything rational telling you that even *if* Kyuubey had blabbed about Homura's power, even *if* the Iowa girls had known you'd be coming, even *if* they had the appropriate power to set up a trap, even *if* they had the sheer range to set up a trap ranging hundreds of kilometers, Sayaka would spot it well in advance.

You flick a glance back. Determined gazes meet yours, your friends and allies -well, really, if they came all this way out here because of you, you pretty much consider them *all* friends- coming alert. No words need to be spoken, not now.

Sayaka nods at you, expression sharply focused and intent. She's on the lookout, and she's not taking it lightly, either.

Mami draws your attention with another gentle nudge for another course correction, and you face forward again.

"It *is* Mandalay," you murmur.

"I think I see it," Sayaka says, voice tight. "I think I se-"

"Sayaka?" you say sharply. You can feel the electric tension that jolts around the platform - if you weren't all alert and focused before, you are *now*.

"I see it," she says. "They're just outside the city."

"Wait, you see them?" you say. "What's '*it*'?"

"A *big* antimagic... cloud?" Sayaka says. "It's gotta be them, right? I'm not seeing anything else."

"Gotta be," you say. "Bearing?"

"Few more degrees to the right," Sayaka says. "Other side of the city from us."

"Got it," you say, adjusting as appropriate.

Mandalay isn't the vast, sprawling metropolis of Mitakihara, but it isn't exactly shabby, either, a respectable city spread across the bank of Irawaddy River. Steady gridlines and densely packed buildings spill across the landscape, testament to the booming growth, new construction stretching for the skies above.

You pay little attention to that, straining your eyes and senses.

Of course, Sayaka's the first to really see it. To *see* it, her clone in the outrider platform picking it out in the distance. You hear her inhale sharply... and then Mami mirrors it, sitting bolt upright.

Exclamations and swearing, as realization flashes between your friends. You slew the platform to a halt, a hundred kilometers distant, and stare.

"That antimagic bubble will prove a problem," Yuki observes. "Miss Vee?"

She's standing now, peering over the heads of the others.

"Do you remember when we first discussed the Iowa group?" she says, tone even and unruffled, as if commenting on the weather.

"Yea-" You blink as you recall your exact words. "... ah."

"'Gunboat diplomacy', you said," Yuki says.

"... I swear I had no idea," you say. "I mean, it was a *guess*, but it was *too damn stupid* to really consider as a viable guess."

"What it is, in retrospect, is a truly *wretched* pun, and you should be ashamed of yourself," Yuki says.

"... yeah, OK, fair enough," you say, staring at the replica of the USS Iowa, BB-61, floating over the city. Frozen and lifeless much like anything else in Homura's timestop, but disappointingly enough, not a hallucination.

*Dammit*.

Magical girls have better eyesight than baseline human. Direct any visual acuity issues at that, if you please. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

Having Oriko and Sayaka attempt to scry will be an automatic action, but this is the point to add on any additional info-gathering suggestions, and any preliminary plans of attack.

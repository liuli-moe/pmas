# Hazard Course Pt. 25

You busy yourself with the tea for a moment, buying yourself a moment to think, and for the newest arrivals to settle themselves in. Storebought butter cookies might not be the best pairing with green tea, but it's not like you give a damn, and nor do Kyouko or Yuma.

With both Norikos and Akemi claiming the space on the other end of the sofa from you and Mami, there's just the one sofa left, which Sayaka flops on. Kyouko sprawls out right beside her, while Yuma happily curls up on the sofa seat on Sayaka's other side as they help themselves to the cookies. For all of Kyouko's casual insouciance, though, you can't help but notice the way watchful crimson eyes flicker to Mami, then to Oriko, then to Noriko and Akemi, taking cues from Mami and carefully evaluating the others.

Perhaps the only person who *might* actually care about the propriety of snack pairings with tea would be Oriko, but... there she sits, savouring her own cup of tea, a half-eaten cookie resting on the delicate porcelain plate in front of her. All things considered, and especially considering Kirika, Oriko probably *welcomes* the disorder and *im*propriety, embracing it to thumb her nose at unlamented, *stifling* tradition.

Hah.

You shake those thoughts free as irrelevant for now, even as you turn your mind to disentangling the matter of the Soujus in relation to the Constellation. Which is in turn a matter you're going to put before your friends anyway, so you turn will into action, telepathy stretching on an invisible web across Japan to Asunaro, to Fukushima, to Ishinomaki. Kazumi, Yuki, and Mika.

Which reminds you that you *do* want to figure out a non-Kyuubey method of telepathy, and that amusingly, the Soujus might once again hold the solution.

But for now, this will do.

"*Good morning, everyone!*" you say. "*I hope I'm not disturbing anything, but I have an update? It's mostly good news.*"

"*One moment\~*" Mika says cheerfully.

"*G'morning,*" Kazumi mumbles. "*Wh' time zzit?*"

"*Just past eleven, Miss Michiru,*" Yuki says, her tone even and unruffled. "*Good morning, Miss Vee. I take it that this would be about the Soujus you mentioned?*"

"*It is, yeah,*" you say. "*I'll, uh, wait for Miss Nakano and Kazumi to be ready, I guess?*"

"*Rather,*" Yuki says drily. "*In the meantime, I have a request from the... *captain* of the Iowa group. Her name is Parr√≥, by the by, which I gather to be her surname. She would like to speak to you, face-to-face.*"

"*I- well, it's kind of related to what I want to bring up today, so, uh... I'll see what I can do with that specific request - I'll probably be passing by sometime soon, and then I'll speak to her at that point?*" you say, shifting uncomfortably on the sofa. "*But we can get to that after the main discussion today if it's more urgent than that?*"

"*That's more than sufficient as far as I'm concerned,*" Yuki says. "*I'd expected as much and told her the same.*"

"*Alright,*" you say. "*Well, in that case, let me loop everyone else in...*"

And just because you *can*, you unfold enough Grief from your storage space to form plaques for everyone, floating in the air over the table. You briefly consider making them ominous black monoliths characterized only by numbers inscribed in glowing red, but ultimately settle on shaping portraits of each of them instead.

"Oooh," Kirika says, clapping happily. "Fancy!"

"Yeah, I thought it might be nice?" you say. "Maybe we should set up full video conferencing of some kind at some point."

"We *do* have a meeting room on the second floor, which does have a full conference suite," Oriko says. "My father... had it installed a while ago."

"... not this time, I think," you say.

Oriko shrugs slightly.

"*Anyway,*" you say, shifting mental gears to include everyone in the conversation. "*Ah, Miss Tsuruya, Kazumi, if you want to bring in your teammates at any point, feel free?*"

Kyouko flicks a look at you, glowering at you and folding her arms.

"*Oh, hey everyone!*" Kazumi says, her voice brightening. You make her portrait expand slightly and bob in the air as she speaks. The visual effect could use a bit more pizzaz, you think. "*Hi Mami!*"

"*Good morning,*" Mami says gravely, shooting you a little smile as she nestles into your side.

"*Yup, yup, I'm here,*" Mika says. "*Had to duck out of a meeting, but it wasn't a particularly important one anyway.*"

"*Oh, sorry about that. Uh, if you have to, you don't have to be here?*" you say. "*And the same for you, Kazumi?*"

"*Nonsense, there's only one Constellation and a billion identical businesspeople, and I'd rather sit in on the unique one,*" Mika says. You can imagine the dismissive wave of her hand. "*And I've got my secretary taking notes anyway.*"

"*And I had Satomi sleeping on my arm, so I couldn't move her, so I went back to sleep!*" Kazumi says brightly. "*You know how it is. But I'm up now, so what's up?*"

"*Alright, well, first thing is that this morning, we were attacked by a pair of Soul Gem collectors, the Soujus. We fought, and captured them,*" you say. "*I've told Miss Tsuruya about them, but Kazumi, Miss Nakano: they're travelling magical girls. They're two sisters sharing a body.*"

Out of the corner of your eye, you notice Noriko and Akemi exchanging a look. They made the *obvious* connection, you suppose, given Noriko's single Soul in *two* bodies. An odd bit of coincidence, but nothing special there.

"*Soul Gem collectors...*" Kazumi mutters, sounding vaguely disquieted. "*So, kidnappers?*"

"*... yeah, pretty much*" you say, glancing back at the Soujus' Soul Gems in turn. They've been perfectly behaved, apart from the magic webbing between them, and you can't really fault them for that. "*As I mentioned, we managed to subdue them. I know you said you'd be willing to hold them, Miss Tsuruya, but they're not... really what I was expecting.*"

"*Oh?*" Yuki says curiously.

"*Yeah, they're...*" you blow out a sigh, tipping your head back to look at the ceiling. "*They're not entirely of right mind. That much was in line with what I was expecting. They're obsessed with the 'shine' of Soul Gems, and preserving that shine, and *that's* why they've been stealing Soul Gems. It was a misguided attempt to *help*, and I'm pretty sure that their Wishes were what messed up their minds.*"

"*And you're reluctant to commit them to imprisonment for that,*" Mika guesses.

"*Exactly so. Also, they, uh,*" you say, shifting uncomfortably on the sofa. Mami wraps an arm around your waist, squeezing gently. "*They seem to low-key worship me, and it freaks me out.*"

Kyouko blinks at you, then cackles, loud and unrepentant. And Sayaka, the traitor, has to cover her smirk with a hand too. Noriko and Akemi both give you dubious looks which, ok, you can't really blame them for.

"*In what way?*" Mika asks, ignoring the amusement radiating from that end of the telepathic call.

"*Apparently they consider me some kind of angel?*" you say, grimacing. Even just *saying* that makes your stomach squirm. "*Because my magic fits some kind of criterion that they've been seeking and raised to the status of, well, divine?*"

"*You sure they weren't flirting with you?*" Kazumi asks. She sounds dead serious, too.

"*...*" You enunciate the ellipsis over telepathy as clearly as you can, pairing it with the sensation a disapproving eyebrow. You hope. "*Yeah, I'm sure. It was... basically religious fervour. Like, I'm not joking when I say it sort of freaked -freak*s*- me out.*"

"*Mm. It *does* make guaranteeing good behaviour easier,*" Yuki observes.

"No. *No. I'm not-*," you blurt. You swallow your revulsion at the thought, shaking your head. "*It would be easier, but it's not a path I want to even consider.*"

"*... more than fair,*" Yuki allows after a considering pause. "*I apologise.*"

"*It's fine,*" you say. "*Just... that's a dark, *dark* path, and I'm staying the *hell* away from it. That's all.*"

"*I understand. And again, I sincerely apologise,*" Yuki says.

You let out a breath, Mami squeezing your shoulders gently, which you lean into gratefully.

"*Right... moving on. There's two more things about the Soujus to top it all off,*" you say. "*First: they're Soul Gem thieves, and we *did* manage to recover all their victims. I'll be working on re-embodying them.*"

Mika whistles.

"*That's gonna be a heck of a task,*" she says. "*Not just getting them bodies, but also sorting out what to *do* with them afterwards. They've... probably been declared dead back home.*"

"*Probably,*" you agree. "*But it's nothing less than they deserve.*"

"*'course,*" Mika says. "*I can probably get them in touch with lawyers if they need help. Nakano Corp doesn't have the right sort of lawyers on retainer, but they'll know people.*"

"*I... might have to take you up on that soon, thank you,*" you say. "*Figuring out what I can do for them isn't gonna be easy.*"

"*What *we* can do,*" Kazumi says. "*Niko'd be interested in helping figure out how to get them bodies, if you haven't got that on lock yet.*"

"*I... that would be *fantastic*,*" you say. "*I've barely got ideas for how to begin the actual process there, I admit, so any help would be great.*"

"*Ahh, I'd be in trouble if I *didn't* grab that opportunity for Niko,*" Kazumi says. "*Niko'd be upset with me.*"

You snort, leaning back and surveying the room. Kirika's tuned out ages ago, you're pretty sure, curled up on Oriko's lap instead and playing with her hair. Oriko offers you the hint of a smile, content to let things play out for now. Noriko and Akemi are both alert, listening closely even if they haven't really said anything so far. Still, they seem interested in the proceedings.

Kyouko... is listening. For all that she *seems* to be focusing mainly on her snacks -an orange, now, of all things, slices shared with Yuma and Sayaka- you can tell she's *listening*, her eyes sharp and watchful.

Mami squeezes you gently, smiling at you before you even turn to her, and you can't help but huff in amusement.

"*Alright, so that's one thing,*" you say after a moment to gather your thoughts. "*The other is that the Soujus... have a method to handle Grief.*"

*That* gets everyone sitting up straight, physically present or not. Well, apart from Kirika, who opts instead to nestle further into Oriko's lap.

"*Explain,*" Yuki says sharply, the first to recover.

"*It's not like mine,*" you say. "*The way they explained it, they have some technique involving shuffling Grief between Soul Gems and somehow dissipating it in the process. It *sounds* like it's just a matter of slowly... peeling off scraps of Grief and dispersing it. I don't know enough about it yet, and I intend to find out more.*"

"*Ah,*" Yuki says. "*That sounds... less usable than your method, Miss Sabrina.*"

"*And it simultaneously sounds like something that might potentially be *learned*,*" Mika observes. "*Unless it's something to do with their Wishes?*"

"*It might be, on all three counts,*" you allow. "*But it's very potentially a starting point for a technique that might be taught. I don't know yet.*"

"*Mm,*" Mika says. "*So it seems to me that therein lies quite the knotty problem. They have knowledge that you want, and yet you're not comfortable in keeping them close, nor do you want to remand them to Miss Tsuruya's care. It seems to me that solutions are... sparse.*"

"*Yeah,*" you agree with a sigh. "*And... let me put it up front that I don't really like that I'm having Miss Tsuruya run an oubliette, and I want to figure out *something* there. We might not be able to come up with anything on that front today, but it's something that I've been keeping on my mind. Just... it's not *right* to ask one of my friends to run a jail, long term, and it's not actually any kind of *solution* except in the short term.*"

A flash of seafoam green in the corner of your eyes is Oriko giving you an amused look.

"*I'll note that it isn't too onerous a duty for the present moment,*" Yuki says. "*And I *did* agree to it in the first place, and for now, it might be the best option that there is. But as we've previously discussed, I do not want to maintain it in perpetuity, so the consideration is welcome. I understand that you would rather move to something more rehabiliatory, correct?*"

"*Yeah,*" you say. "*Still, that's... longer term, I suppose.*"

"*Rehabilitation is one thing,*" Mika agrees. "*But what of justice? Consider the Soujus, for example. Their victims might very well demand *justice* be done, as opposed to simple restitution. I doubt they'd be happy to know the Soujus might be walking free.*"

"*Oh, yeah, I know,*" you say gloomily. "*It... like. They have every right to demand justice. I just don't know what I can offer there, in either the specific case of the Soujus or in a general case. With the Iowa group, for example.*"

You let that hang in the air for the moment. It's a thorny subject to handle at the best of times, the musings of more than two thousand years of human history testament to *that*, and you're not sure you have a good answer to it *now*.

# Under the Radar pt. 23

You keep your hands on Mami's. Your own stomach churns uneasily. "No!" you blurt. "*No*, not like... no. Never, Mami."

A fraction of your attention, that cold, analytical part, watches Mami's Soul Gem carefully, the Grief ticking up in jolts and spikes. The *rest* of you frets, watching Mami's anguish helplessly, your mind whirling with thoughts.

"T-then-" Mami's hands *shiver* in yours, and she tries half heartedly to pull back. You tighten your grip, and she stops trying to pull back, making a low, agonized keening noise.

She doesn't meet your eyes.

Her eyes stay on your joined hands, tears starting to gather at the corners of her eyes.

"Mami," you say, words rushing over each other in your effort to *make this better*. "Mami, after I woke up in that alley, I had no idea I would find a, a best friend, someone who believed -believe*s*- in me so strongly, so quickly. I... I couldn't, I *can't* imagine anyone who would accept me like you do. It... you snuck up on me."

"But." You lick dry lips. "Mami, you mean *so much* to me. I tried to-" you swallow hard, "-I tried to *protect* you from some of the ugly things I know. And. And I was... I was *afraid* of what you would think of me. What you would *do*."

"S-Sa-," Mami stutters. She blinks furiously, trying to hold back the tears glimmering at the corners of her golden eyes. "Sabrina, I... I can't- I don't-" She breaks off mid sentence, floundering for words.

"Mami, *I'm sorry.*" You say it as earnestly as you can, your grip on her hands tightening. Your heart *aches* at the sight of Mami looking so lost, so uncertain. "I was wrong, and it was a mistake. Because a best friend deserves my complete trust. Because *you* deserve my complete trust, Mami. Because..." You swallow hard. "Because you've placed so much faith in me. Because... I want to be able to stand beside you without feeling like I don't deserve to."

You try, again, to swallow the lump that seems to be lodged in your throat as you watch Mami struggle with herself - with what you're saying. "And... it isn't *right*, Mami, that I keep all this from you. It's been... eating at me, Mami. And..." You try to smile, but it's a ghastly, half-formed thing. "You know me. If I see something wrong, I have to *fix* it. Especially so if *I'm* the one in the wrong."

You fall silent, watching Mami as she tries to process your words. Her mouth works, but nothing comes out, tears beginning to streak down her face. You squeeze her hands lightly in yours. "Mami, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I didn't want to lose you," you say in low, wretched voice.

Mami shakes her head weakly. "I-I," she tries. "I. Sabrina. J-ju- I- Y-you'll s-stay, right?"

"*Yes,*" you say fervently. "Mami, I won't leave you."

With an inarticulate wail, she lunges at you, throwing her arms around you. You return the hug, holding her close as she shivers in your embrace. "I'm here, Mami," you say. "I'm here. And I'm here to *stay*."

She doesn't cry much, curling into your side, cold shudders wracking her body in quivering waves. You hold on to her, trying to comfort her, to reassure you that you're not leaving her.

"Mami," you say softly, stroking her back gently. "I. I'm going to tell you everything I can. I'm going to... struggle through whatever's difficult to explain." You can think of a few ways to do it, including an object demonstration of your *knowledge*. But...

"For what isn't mine to tell, I'll try to persuade them," you continue on. "But... Mami, there's some things I'm-" you gulp softly, thinking of what could happen, *has* happened else*when*, "-too afraid to say... please, Mami, I beg for time. Just... enough time for me to work through my... fears."

"N-n," Mami says. "N-no. I. I-I don't n-need to k-know, Sabrina. J-just. Just. Stay. I, I, it's alright." Her Soul Gem, the ring on her finger, doesn't seem to be accumulating much more accumulation at the moment. It's... about a third full. Not critical, but not healthy, either.

By the way, if *and only if* you guys do the Babel-on vote, do me a favour and do the translations for me if there's a specific phrase you guys are particularly enamoured of - *not*-Google Translate greatly preferred. I'm on vacation and I'm not going to figure out the grammars of a dozen different languages for this. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

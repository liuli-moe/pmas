# To the White Forest pt. 19

"Oh, Homura," you whisper, your heart breaking for her. "I-"

You're going with your first instinct here.

"Can I hug you?" you blurt.

Homura shrugs, the barest rise and fall of her shoulders, and you immediately pull her back into a hug. Her arms hang limp at her side, but she leans into your hug. Just a bit.

You take the moment to think, to really *think* through what she said, what she's *asking*. She's *lost*. From her point of view, you've simply swept in and, well. You swept in and *fixed* everything, just like Madoka Wished to, last loop.

It's an existential crisis on two fronts: Homura Wished to redo her first meeting with Madoka, to be the one to *protect* her. And Madoka *asked* Homura to stop her from making a Wish. And here you are, probably a *result* of Madoka's Wish, doing everything to protect Madoka.

And you...

You don't know how to fix this. Because the existential crisis is *rightfully* so. You *are* sweeping in to fix things. You couldn't have done it without her - you *can't* do what you do without her. But that just... doesn't mitigate the fact that *you* are bearing the weight. With her friendship and support and with the culmination of everything she's done.

Which means you don't know what you *can* tell Homura.

But-

No.

That's not true, is it?

Someone else blazed the trail first. *Two* someones blazed your trail for you. And you *need* your friends at your back, to *help* you and to keep you sane. You're fighting for *them*. You're leading, but you're not doing it alone.

You take a shuddering breath, before pulling back and smiling at Homura. A thought wipes Grief form your Soul Gem, and you give Homura a questioning look. She nods wordlessly, and you cleanse her Gem too.

"Sit down?" you murmur. "I- I think this is going to be a long talk, but it's necessary."

She nods again, jerky and stiff.

Maneuvering so that you can both sit down without letting go of Homura is a little tricky, but you both wind up sitting comfortably beside the coffee table. Sayaka and Mami are both in view in front of you, that little edge of worry cast in stark relief on Mami's face.

You don't think she's ever going to lose that fear of letting you go, not for a long time, but... that's a matter for another time.

For now, you focus on Homura. Homura, who's frail and hunched, looking down at her lap. You have her hand, your grip loose around her wrist.

"What do you want to know?" you ask gently. "I... Homura... I don't want you to..."

You grope at the air, looking for a word.

"I don't want you to be upset," you finish. "And- I guess, too late for that, but I want to *help*. I'll answer your questions, as much as I can, as *best* as I can. I've got some ideas, I guess, but... do you want me to start anywhere? Do you want me to address anything in particular?"

Homura shakes her head mutely.

"Then... I guess I'm going to share some thoughts I've been having," you say slowly, leaning back and propping yourself up on your free hand to look up at the ceiling. "Asunaro was too easy."

You give Homura a grin, even if she doesn't look up at you. It's for your own benefit, as much as anything else, to keep your mood up.

"I know, I know," you say. "Asunaro was a mess. Hell, it still is, a bit, but they're stable now. I don't know how much you've interacted with them in the past, but... Look, by all rights they *should* have been a bag full of crazy, high on Grief and what I can only describe as yandere love. I think I went over this with you before, right?"

Homura doesn't answer, opting instead to shrug.

"And then there's Nagisa," you say, chasing that line of thought. As much as you need to tell Homura this, you're shaping this for yourself, too. "She... she should be a Witch by now. Charlotte. The Witch that..."

Your voice fails you, the bite of horror a sharp knife to your gut. You motion at Mami, in lieu of continuing.

Homura nods. You can feel the weight of her eyes on you for a moment.

"Yeah," you say, and cleanse your Soul Gem, checking Homura's. She's fine. "And yet, here she is. Not even a magical girl. And of course, Oriko, and Kirika."

You can feel Homura stiffen, the tendons in her wrist bunching as she clenches her hand into a fist.

"I... I'm not talking about whether they're good guys, or not," you say. You'd rather not poke *that* particular trauma right now. Not when you know you're going to wind up jamming your finger into another one. "But it's... different. Oriko got a different vision, that much is clear, and Kirika didn't get her time slow. She got her antimagic, something *perfectly* suited to helping Oriko, and not just to fight us."

A breath in, and a slow sigh as you continue staring at the light fixture on the ceiling, grey and cold from the timestop.

"And Sayaka, of course," you say. "I don't need to tell you how she usually treats you."

"That's *your* doing," Homura mutters quietly.

"Maybe," you say. "But... there's too much here that's *different*. And I know there are variations from time to time-" like Kyousuke being a guitarist "-but there's too *much* for me to say it's just the timeline being a bit different, right? I- you'd know better than I would, here."

Homura nods silently, gaze flickering over to you for a second. You push off the floor, tipping forward to face her again.

"The only thing I can come back to is Madoka's Wish, last loop," you say quietly. Homura's gaze snaps to you, the weight of her regard and the choking *anguish* almost a physical thing that rocks you back.

"I-" Homura's voice chokes off.

"I'm sorry," you say, bowing your head. "I know it hurts. But I'm bringing it up for a reason. I... Homura, Madoka's Wish transcended *time*. Her Wish is still helping. Things are *different*, and *better* this time. Everything *can* be fixed."

Homura doesn't respond, her breathing shallow and slow.

Please, Madokami, let this work. You don't know if she's out there or not, but you *believe* in her, in her Wish.

"I know you can't be happy if Madoka isn't safe, and if you're not the one protecting her," you say. "And I know that Madoka can only be happy if *you* are. I *know* Madoka must have realised that. She's like that, isn't she? She's so much smarter than anyone would guess at first glance."

"I don't- I just need her to be safe," Homura whispers.

"OK," you say, bowing your head again. "I... Homura, my metaknowledge focused on some people. You and Madoka the most, and I know, I *know* Madoka cares about you. I don't know exactly what happened last loop, but I *know* she must have Wished thinking of you."

"It's a failure," Homura whispers. "I failed."

Please, Madokami.

You cleanse Homura's Soul Gem again, draining away to slow seepage of despair. "She wasn't tricked into that Wish," you murmur. "Homura, Madoka is so much kinder, so much smarter, than anyone might guess at. You know that better than anyone. And... she'd never do anything that could make someone as strong as you cry, right?"

Homura nods jerkily.

"She knew what she was doing," you say quietly, meeting her eyes. She's not crying, her expression simply... lost. "I believe that. I know her, not as well as you do, but... she wouldn't have made that Wish without a good reason."

"I suppose what I'm saying is that you can be happy, Homura." You sigh, and smile. "You're not alone. In more than one way. I'm here, yes, but I'm here to *help*. Madoka's Wish means that we *can* do this."

"*How*?" Homura whispers, her voice raw and agonized. "I don't deserv- I *can't*."

So... here's something I'd like to reiterate: the wordcount is a guideline, at best. I had it in the first place because votes were bloating out to ridiculous degrees that were unwieldy and awful to work with. But shorter doesn't necessarily mean better. I'm incredibly busy these days, and I frequently only have time to skim the thread. This means that I may miss context and important points.

So what I'm saying is that if adhering to the wordcount means you lose clarity, then *forget* that wordcount.

Speaking of which, I've removed said wordcount for this vote. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# Hazard COurse Pt. 40

Spoiler: Winning vote

- [x] During Lunch:
- [x] Update the others on our itinerary.
  - [x] When I leave here, I'm going to visit the Iowa group leader
    - [x] I want to know what she has to say before our meeting with Shin this evening to explain what happened to him and Nagisa.
  - [x] After I'll get the cake we promised to bring to the meeting with the Kagoshima group tomorrow at 4
  - [x] I'll find Kyoko and Yuma after that
    - [x] Homura, do you think your hacker friend could sort out the paperwork to get Yuma into school? I'll float the idea to Kyoko and Yuma if so.
- [x] Make some calls
  - [x] Ask if Rin is willing to help Niko with the Soujus victims
  - [x] Contact the Murasaki Shrine Maidens and schedule a meeting for tomorrow
    - [x] Decide whether to meet them on the way to the Kagoshima group meeting or on the way back.
- [x] After Lunch
- [x] Planned timestop talk
  - [x] Resist the urge to apologize again, Sabrina. I believe in you.
  - [x] With Homura adding and dropping people as needed while we discuss what we can and should tell Madoka
    - [x] Proposal: Bring Hitomi in on the Witchbomb since she's in no danger from it.
      - [x] Tell Hitomi before moving on to other proposals if agreed to.
    - [x] Proposal: We offer to tell Madoka everything if and only if the alternative is her making a contract in ignorance
      - [x] Cosmic truths, personal traumas, things that aren't our story to tell, everything.
      - [x] Obviously, this doesn't preclude us telling her other stuff if we're all agreed. This is about agreeing how to handle an emergency.
      - [x] I think that's what we'd all do if we encountered that as an emergency. I want to make it explicit among us
      - [x] I want us to tell Madoka that's how we feel about it.
    - [x] Proposal: We tell Madoka about the risk that she specifically could/would end the world if she makes a contract
      - [x] Madoka is a selfless person and would likely respond more strongly to a threat to others than if the threat was "just" to her own safety.
      - [x] We can say it's because her potential is higher than Kyubey's system can safely handle if we're not comfortable telling her about Witches.
        - [x] Also, Kyubey knows and doesn't care because Madoka's contract would meet his quota for earth so he can write the planet off
    - [x] Does anyone have any other ideas or thoughts?
  - [x] With Madoka
    - [x] Follow through with what we agreed on in the previous step.
    - [x] Ask Madoka how she's feeling because we haven't had much chance to talk
      - [x] Don't interupt. Listen.

The conversation lapses for a few minutes as everyone returns to eating properly, and to your surprise, it's Homura who next breaks the silence, neatly setting her chopsticks down on her lunchbox with a precise click that somehow draws your attention, amethyst eyes meeting yours steadily.

"Are the Soujus safe?" Homura murmurs quietly.

There's a slight edge to her words, the faintest emphasis on the last word of her question. And you get it: not safe as in protected from danger, but safe as in whether those glowing green rocks are radioactive or not. *Safe*, as in whether she should tolerate their continued existence in Mitakihara.

Safe, as in whether it's *safe* to allow them to exist even remotely near Madoka.

"... I think so," you say, nodding slowly. "I... as much as I *am* uncomfortable with the whole... *angel* thing, they do seem to genuinely mean it. So they'll listen to me."

Homura nods, apparently satisfied, and picks her chopsticks back up.

"Oh, also, Homura - we *can* talk after lunch, right?" you ask.

She nods again, and you beam at her.

"By the by," Hitomi asks after another moment of quiet eating. "On the subject of the Soujus, what *are* we doing with the Soujus? I believe you said they were staying with Miss Watanabe and Miss Saito?"

"Oh, yeah, they volunteered to take them in," you say with a wince. "It's... the Soujus are apparently completely happy to just stay as Soul Gems, so they're not taking extra room or anything, and... I *think* they'll be on their best behaviour because of, er, their *attitude* towards me. Though the specifics of that 'best behaviour' might need, uh, guidance. So I'd say that situation is stable, and I'll... step in if Miss Saito and Miss Watanabe can't handle it, I guess?"

"That seems appropriate, yes," Hitomi agrees.

"Does it really make you that uncomfortable?" Madoka asks curiously.

"It's..." you stuff some rice into your mouth, buying some time to think as you chew and swallow. "Look, I'm a really weird magical girl. But I'm just *me*. Calling me an angel is... it's putting me in a position I never earned, you know? A religious figure is... something distant, something you hold up in your mind and, and *worship*. I'm not. I'm *here*, with you and everyone else, fighting *together* for the same things."

Mami bumps her shoulder against yours, pressing closer to your side.

"That's rather Abrahamic-centric of you, Sabrina," Hitomi comments, amusement in her expression as she wags a finger at you. "I would contrast Shintoism, or indeed animistic religions in general, in terms of how, ah, *interactive* one might be, though I *do* suppose the concept of angels is mostly a Christian thing. So I'll concede the point."

You grin at her, amused. You were a little worried that she'd taken that jab about the luxury apartments to heart, but... no, there's no hesitance or dismay in her expression. It was just good-natured teasing, and she took it in the spirit it was intended - just as you'll take *this* teasing in the spirit it was intended.

"'sides, angels are the ones empowered to go out and *do* stuff, aren't they?" Sayaka notes. "So it's OK, no?"

"Ennnh," you say. "I'll grant both of you the argument, but just... it makes me uncomfortable. Rationally it's just neutral at most, some good things about it, some bad things, but just..." You wave your hand vaguely. "Bleh."

"And there's nothing wrong with that!" Madoka says, twintails bouncing with her vigorous nod. "If they make you uncomfortable, then you don't need to address them personally! You don't have to do *everything* yourself, right?"

"Agreed," Mami says lightly. "Really, we have friends, and an entire alliance. Don't hoard all of the tough jobs for yourself, Sabrina."

"Right," you say, beaming at your friends. "I'm still gonna keep an eye on the situation and see if I *do* need to step in, and figure out where we can get all the resources we need, but... yeah. Thank you, everyone."

Sayaka snickers.

"Feels like we really do need that health care professional on board," she notes.

"Yeah... I might have to trouble you for that introduction sooner rather than later, Madoka," you say, sighing lightly.

"I'll be sure to ask papa," Madoka says. "And I'm sure he'll be happy to help."

"Thanks, Madoka," you say, beaming at her. "Can't help but feel that a personal connection might make this sort of thing easier to read in, but anyway, yeah."

You shake your head.

"Anyway!" you say. "Enough of that for now. What's your classes looking like this afternoon?"

"Literature, then PE at the end of the day!" Madoka says.

"PE at the end of the day," Hitomi echoes with an aggrieved sigh.

"I would presume you're still on light exercise, Hitomi?" Mami asks.

"I am," Hitomi says. "Which, I would argue, makes it worse - it's boring *and* tiresome."

"Ah, I see," Mami says, nodding and pursing her lips. "That's unfortunate."

"It is what it is, I suppose," Hitomi says. She shakes her head, then smiles. "I'd take it over actually *having* a still-healing wrist."

Mami chuckles, nodding again in agreement.

"If I recall correctly, you should be covering Lain in literature at about this time, right?" she asks.

"Yeah!" Madoka agrees. "It's rather bleak, but I can see why people hold it in such high esteem."

"Lain, as in Serial Experiments Lain?" you ask curiously.

"That's the one!" Madoka says. "It's classified as modern literature. What about you, Mami? What classes do you have after lunc-" Madoka blinks. "Oh, you'll be accompanying Sabrina still after lunch, Mami?"

"Definitely!" Mami says happily, nudging you in the side. "So what *will* we be doing after lunch, Sabrina?"

"Oh, yeah, I was wanting to update you guys on my plans for the day, yeah. Just to keep everyone in the loop," you say, smiling. "So, uh... right. Couple of things. I'll visiting the Kagoshima group tomorrow afternoon, and they wanted me to get a cake from some cafe in Shinmachi? So I'll be popping over, and if anyone knows that cafe and wants something from there I can pick it up?"

"Never heard of that place," Sayaka offers. "We don't really go down there all that often."

"I'd rather have something Mami baked," Madoka says. "Or you, Sabrina! Both of you are so good at baking... ooh. You should have a cook-off with my papa sometime."

You grin, and exchange a look with Mami, who snickers as she elbows you.

"We'll take *that* challenge anytime," you say. "But uh... yeah, I'm also going to pop off to Fukushima at some point to talk to the leader of the Iowa group."

"Captain, surely," Sayaka says.

"Captai... I guess?" you say. "I mean, I see your point, but it's not a proper maritime vessel, is it?"

"It *is* a ship, is it not?" Hitomi says thoughtfully, popping a grape into her mouth. "One of *the* most famous ships of the modern day, really. So I would tend to agree with Sayaka."

"It was magic," Homura mutters, the words almost seeming to be dragged out of her against her will.

"Yeah!" Madoka says, nodding vigorously. "It wasn't the *real* Iowa, right? Unless..."

"... as far as I know, it's *just* a magical construct that was, admittedly, modelled after the actual Iowa," you say. "I don't *think* she stole the actual Iowa and animated with magic or something like that. I *think*."

"But it was fully functional! I bet if you put it into the water it would float and, y'know, do all the proper boat-y things," Sayaka says, waggling her hands demonstratively as she warms up to the topic. "And that girl was in charge of it, so she's the captain. QED."

"OK, OK." You snap your fingers. "I have an argument to make but before we get into it properly, last thing on my after-lunch agenda is that I'm planning to go hunt down Kyouko and Yuma, and I bring that up because: does anyone want me to bring anything up with them or whatever? Looking at you, Sayaka."

"Uhhhh," Sayaka says. "No, I don't think so? Buy them a couple of anpan on me, I guess?"

"Sure, I can do that," you say, nodding. "Also, while we're on the subject, Mami, Sayaka, do you think Kyouko would want Yuma in school? I *think* Yuma would like to, and we've got the resources to make it happen, between Miss Inoue and our own resources. So... yeah."

"Inoue?" Hitomi asks.

"Magical girl hacker in Ishinomaki, I think I've mentioned her before? She got me my passport and official papers, so getting Yuma into school should be trivial," you say. And Yuuki's also how Homura got Walpurgisnacht into the forecast as a storm, you don't say out loud. "So. I... I just don't *get* Kyouko that well."

Sayaka makes a long, wordless noise of vague thoughtfulness, tugging on a lock of her hair.

"I dunno," she admits. "Like, listen, she talks a big talk about practical learning 'on the streets' and all, but that's all *talk*. She doesn't believe herself half the time."

"I think it's worth making the offer," Mami says, then chuckles softly. "She's not *actually* going to stab you, Sabrina. Especially not over an offer of help made in earnest."

"I don't know," you say doubtfully. "For the record, I don't think she'd *actually* stab me, but I seem to particularly annoy her, so I'm a little leery of being the one to ask."

"Trust me, Sabrina," Mami says, patting your hand gently. "And besides, I'll be there with you."

"Always," you say, smiling. You take a deep breath. "Alright. Now, back to the actual important topics at hand, look, Sayaka. She's not, as far as we know, a part of any form of uniformed service with an official rank system to hold said rank absent of an actual command. Yeah? And since *we* took her ship, one of us gets to be the captain now."

You snap your fingers, focusing for a moment and letting your costume twist to add a cap to your head, flat-topped in white and trimmed in gold, with a short, black brim pulled over your eyes.

"But you don't *have* a ship, either," Sayaka points out, setting her lunchbox aside. "Also, gimme that."

"Well, if that counts, neither does Parró, so she's not a captain now is she?" you say with a grin, leaning back and out of the way of Sayaka's grabbing hand.

"Did she ever formally surrender?" Hitomi asks.

You're too busy trying to fend off Sayaka's flailing arms without leaving your seat beside Mami to respond.

"Not that I recall," Mami says thoughtfully. "As such... right of conquest, perhaps?"

"I'm not sure that applies here, you don't claim a title directly by conquest, and we didn't claim the property in question," Madoka says, giving you a doubtful look while ignoring the way you have your hand on Sayaka's face, relying on your superior reach to keep her away.

"So we're in agreement, then!" you say around Sayaka. "*Not* captain."

"A*ha*," Sayaka proclaims triumphantly, one foot planted on the bench to give her *just* enough reach to snatch the cap from your head. She backs off and grins, settling the cap on her head at a jaunty angle. "Who's the captain *now*?"

"No one is, we just went over this," Hitomi says reprovingly. "Do try to keep up, Sayaka."

Bah, apologies for the late update and the relative brevity. The timestop talk should happen next post, and it's gonna be a big one, but this vote is for two things: first, to make sure that I've understood what was intended, as per the new vote, and second, to offer any specific proposition to address Homura's concerns. She is *not* rational about Madoka's safety, or the possibility of her contracting. I can autopilot Sabrina talking to Homura about it, but if you have any specific suggestions, now's the time.

Also, I'm bad about enforcing the word count limits, but seriously, this is a bit much. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

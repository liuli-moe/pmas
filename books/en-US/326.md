# Interloper pt. 39

"Yes, let's go," you say, rolling your neck. You take a step forward, plunging into the Barrier hanging on the wall in front of you.

Scorching heat blasts into your face. Your skin feels *tight* and *dry* as you fight your instinctive *revulsion* at the sensation of Witch, Witch *Witch* all around you. You look around the Barrier as Mami appears behind you.

You're standing on dry, cracked soil that's a solid, orangey-pink hue. Around you, smokeless fires roar in virtual *walls*, enormous pillars of scorching heat scattered across the rolling hills of the landscape, flames blazing up well past your head. Infernos gout up into the sky, plumes bursting and rising in tremendous fireballs. The air above you *shimmers* with the heat.

Despite the heat, you're not sweating.

"Cheery place," you say, smiling at Mami. She smiles back, looking around at the fiery, apocalyptic landscape.

"It certainly is," Mami agrees, heavy irony in her voice.

You huff out a breath, glancing at the masses of Grief that followed you into the Barrier, a titanic mass of spheres cast in a deep purple so dark it's nearly black.

Honestly, goofing off a little, just a *little*, with your powers, sounds good. You've... put yourself through a lot of self recrimination lately, haven't you? And, well, maybe you deserve some of it, but then again, maybe not. You've done *some* good, at least. And you can afford to have a little fun, you think.

You smile.

"Hey, Mami?" you say.

"Mmm?" she asks, looking at you.

"I'm going to try something," you say.

Mami bites her lip. "Be careful, Sabrina," she says. "I'll keep watch?"

"Yeah, I will," you agree. "And... this shouldn't be dangerous, just... bigger than anything I've done before."

Mami nods, 'pulling' one of her trademark muskets from her sleeve and raising it to a half alert position as she scans the landscape around you.

You take a deep breath, turning to face at the masses of Grief drifting slowly through the air. You take two steps towards it, stopping just shy of touching range.

And you *focus*. Grief. Raw material that you can work with. You've never tried anything *quite* on this scale before, but you've never had any trouble before, have you?

You thrust one clawed hand skywards. The Grief leaps into the air, deep purple spheres soaking in the light cast by the fires of the Witch's Barrier. You gesture, arms swinging open in a grandiose gesture. You pivot to face Mami, a broad smile on your face and arms spread wide as you sweep into a bow.

You don't need to look behind you to see what's happening - you can *feel* every speck of Grief freewheeling across the backdrop of flame. Heavy sloped slabs of Grief, adamantine armour layered over a supporting skeleton of armour to form a hulking, bulky form that tapers off to a long tail.

A pair of powerful, stocky legs slam into the ground, supporting the enormous weight of the body, and a smaller pair of arms form further up the body. Huge, swept back spikes run the length of its back from head to tail, lending it a cruelly dangerous look. Its body stands at an angle, leaning forward so that an angular, jagged head can leer down at you with a pair of jaws filled with starkly defined teeth. Deepset eyes glare down at the pair of puny girls standing at its feet, eyes that could, in an instant, kindle to life with fearsome power at your will.

From the belly of the beast leers a caricature of a face, a huge, angular mouth yawning wide in an enormous smirk. Over the eyes juts an enormous, triangular pair of sunglasses, glinting in the light.

You straighten from your bow, grinning widely enough to do your mecha proud. "Would you care for a ride, Mami?" A twist of will, and behind you, the mecha you built takes a step back, and it dips into a low crouch, presenting the cavity in the top of its head -the cockpit, one with a single chair and a console full of switches in front of it- to you.

Mami stares, eyes wide in shock and surprise. Slowly, she blinks once, and then she throws her head back and *laughs*, clear peals ringing out in stark defiance of the Barrier. She steps forward and throws her arms around you, still laughing.

"Oh, *Sabrina*," she gasps between breathless, bubbling giggles. "I-is that *mecha Godzilla*? And Gurren Laggan?"

You pout. "Well," you say. "Not to put too fine a point on it... Yes. Yes, it is."

*That* draws a fresh round of laughter from her. "Oh *Sabrina*," Mami gasps. "I- I'm sorry for laughing, Sabrina, but it's *Mecha Godzilla Gurren Laggan*."

You begin laughing yourself. "N-no, that's q-quite OK. It *is* a bit overdone." You grin up at the cockpit of the mecha - well. You *say* cockpit, really, it's a chair. "Hey, Mami, I'm going to finish this up, OK? It's... going to feel like a Witch."

Mami nods, still giggling as she steps back to give you room to work. Despite her mirth, through, her eyes are still alert, darting around the Barrier.

You turn back to your MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN. Allcaps, even inside your head, because it absolutely deserves it. You clap your hands together, and focus, once more. You *could* make the drill key, but then again, nah, you're only going to take this reference so far.

Colour blooms to vivid life, washing over the MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN in brilliant blue and grey, the same colours of your costume. Solid Grief turns to *metal*, and bearings, and servoes, impossibly strong to support an impossible construct. White highlights accentuate the leering face cast across its belly, and scintillating yellow light kindles to life in the eyes of *both* faces.

*Witch*.

The fires dotting the landscape crackle louder, plumes of fire bursting into the air more energetically.

"Sabrina!" Mami's voice calls in warning, and her musket thunders out a shot.

You spin just in time to see the shot punch into one of the walls of flame- *they're moving*.

You look around frantically.

The patches, the *walls* of flame are closing in on you.

Another shot booms out, hissing harmlessly through the wall of flame. "I think the Familiars are *inside* the fire!" Mami calls.

"Mami, c'mon!" you say, taking a long step forward and hopping up to the cockpit riding atop MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN's head in a single smooth, flowing motion. You turn, holding a hand out to Mami.

She nods, and tosses the musket aside, leaping to join you in the cockpit.

An effort of will, and MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN rears back, roaring defiance against the scintillating heat of the sky above, with the two of you effortlessly staying balanced in the cockpit, supported by grips on the chair back. Another twist of your mind, and the cockpit seals shut, the walls turning perfectly transparent. A vent in the console clicks open, and cool air starts blowing out, bringing welcome relief from the heat.

Mami lets out a surprised laugh. "I... this feels *strange*, but... this is *amazing*, Sabrina," she says.

"And the air conditioning's nice, too," you say. You focus for another split second, and one chair becomes two, side by side.

"True," Mami agrees. "Hmm... how do we fight from in here?"

"Well," you say, frowning. MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN shifts its weight, one mighty, clawed foot lifting and stepping on one of the patches of fire crowding around its knees, snuffing it out. "Bit slow, though," you say critically.

Mami chuckles. "Could you make me some openings? Run... channels to the arms?"

"Sure," you say. An effort of will opens up small, hollow pipes running from the bottom of the cockpit, dozens of little holes opening along the forearms of your mecha. Mami gives you a smile, and raises her hand, ribbons unfurling and spreading in a golden cascade to plunge into the openings.

A moment later, dozens of muskets poke out of the openings on your titan's arms.

"Well," you grin. "I can work with this."

Mami shoots you a quick smile, and frowns in concentration. Intuiting what she's going to do, you shift MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN's arms to a better firing position, aiming down at the Familiars crowding around the feet of your mecha. Stuttering, staggered booms sound, and shots rain down in a fusillade. Some of the Familiars are snuffed out, gouts of fire vanishing.

"Off centre, clever," Mami says, nodding. The muskets eject from the firing ports, unravelling as they fall to the ground, far below.

"Well," you say. "Let's get to it." You drop into one of the chairs -nicely cushioned with real Grief-leather- and motion for Mami to do the same. She obliges with a smile, and MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN starts forward.

One mighty step forward for a mecha, one giant setback for half a dozen Familiars. The ones under your feet, specifically. Golden shots slam down from MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN, thunderbolts roaring down with unerring accuracy to wreak havoc amongst the blazing firestorms. Under your will, MECHA GUREN ZILLA LAGANN shifts to the side, pivoting on one foot, its massive, spiked whirling forward to pound Familiars into the ground, bursts of flame sputtering out in pitiful coughs.

You march forward, the Familiars trying, and failing to retaliate against the invading titan in their land. You leave behind you... well, nothing in particular, but a trail of enormous clawed footprints in the dry, red soil.

Motion in the corner of your eye, and you swivel your chair to take a better look. Something *massive*, a tremendous cloud of obscuring, roiling black smoke thundering across the landscape.

"Uh, Mami, is that..." you start.

"Witch," Mami agrees. "Um, should we..." She gestures around at the cockpit.

ENEMY TEAM IS BABIES. EXCEPT THAT GUY.

No seriously. Giant mecha versus Familiars. What *did* you expect? ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

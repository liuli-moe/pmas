# Direct Intervention pt. 38

You shrug fractionally, maintaining the flow of magic to your own hands with careful precision. "I'm just curious. It can't hurt to talk about it, right?" you say nonchalantly. "Certainly better than just sitting here in silence."

As if to prove you wrong, Homura maintains a stony silence and a blistering glare at you.

You roll your eyes. "There *is* method to my madness, Homura. Answer me this. Do you consider spending time with Madoka an acceptable goal? I know, I know, you want to protect her first. My question remains."

Homura maintains her glare. At least you know she's listening to you.

"So, well. If we, well, Mami and I, invite her over again, then we can also invite *you*. And it'd be nice to know, for example, what kind of food you like - you know as well as I do that Mami would be *delighted* to prepare it for you," you say. "So one more time, Akemi Homura: What's your favourite food?"

Silence, as Homura just frowns at you. You can tell she's listening; she's just not convinced.

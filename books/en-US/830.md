# Hazard Course Pt. 18

Her friends.

Her *friends*?

Your mind reels through a fit of paranoia - if these are her friends, then you've got to secure them too just in case. *And* it might mean the Soujus aren't quite what you think of them, though it doesn't really change the balance of your actions here. If they had good intentions, sneaking up on you in ambush position was *not* the right thing to do, and nor was using other Soul Gems as *batteries* for their own magic.

Better safe than sorry - and with Sayaka still struggling to control her heaving, with Yuma curled tightly into Kyouko's side, you're not willing to take the risk of a fight breaking out again. You need to check in on them, but you need to be sure first.

It takes a heartbeat for logic to coalesce into a decision, and it's nothing all that different from what you'd *intended* to do. Thought turns to action, Grief sweeping in to cocoon the *seven* Soul Gems the Soujus were carrying. Five that they'd been pouring their own Grief into, and another two that had been quiet the entire time. Backups, perhaps.

Even so, you sweep them all up in Grief, cocooning them just as you did Ayase's Soul Gem. None of the seven show any life or magic now, not even the five that the Soujus had been pouring Grief into during the fight. *All* of them are now quiescent in unconsciousness, the barest trickle of Grief and life flickering within them - in stark contrast to the veritable blaze of an active magical girl like your own... or Ayase and Luca's Soul Gems. You keep them all cleansed, of course, as well as Mami's and Kyouko's and Yuma's.

Not Sayaka, now wobbling to a standing position on shaky feet - but that's because her real Soul Gem is back in school, with Madoka and hopefully Homura keeping an eye on her.

While you're at it, it takes a sliver of attention to extend the reach of your Grief cloud once more, spreading it out to keep the rain off the roof and to dissipate the smell from Sayaka's puddle of sick - you can do that much for your friends, at least. It does little for the rain pooling in puddles on the asphalt or the chill in the air, but at least you're not still getting wet.

You take the moment to sweep the Souju's body parts into hammerspace, too. No need to leave it all lying around, especially given Sayaka's response. Each part fully enclosed in Grief, each cut still sealed perfectly and oxygenated so that the parts don't actually die. For given values of 'die', anyway.

"*So long as they offer me no violence, I have *zero* intention of hurting them any further, nor you,*" you respond. "*I promise. You're... Souju Ayase, correct?*"

"*You know our *name*?*" she asks, her voice suddenly eager and *hungry*.

Mami catches your eye, moving over to you with a slightly distant smile, Luca's Soul Gem captive with lock firmly in place. From the looks of it, she's holding her own careful conversation with Luca.

"*I know of you, yes, but I think that there's some gaps in my knowledge,*" you say slowly. "*I... alright. Before we get into any further discussion, you should know that I have every intention of healing you. I'm not going to leave you to die.*"

"*And you'll bring me back to my sister?*" Ayase asks. There's an edge to her voice, the faintest vibrato of concern.

"*... if that's what you want, I'll see what I can do, yeah,*" you say. "*But if you don't mind my asking, why did you attack us?*"

"*We wanted to *know* for sure!*" Ayase says, that edge gone just as abruptly as it had appeared, now replaced with a bright, manic cheer. "*We could see the shine of your Soul, but we had to be *sure*! And you *are*! You're the angel we've only ever *dreamed* of!*"

Her mental presence almost seems to twine around yours, fever-hot and intense and eagerly, so very eagerly focused on *you*.

"*I, uh-*" Your thoughts stutter slightly, uncomfortable in the face of her... enthusiasm. "*Right. Uh, does that mean you're done fighting?*"

"*Oh? Oh, yes, of course, anything you say,*" Ayase agrees, far too fervent for your liking.

"*Right. Uh, give me a moment, I'm going to talk to my friends,*" you say.

"*Don't take too long\~!*" Ayase says.

Mami's eyes flick over to you as you wrench the mental connection away from Ayase, because of course she immediately noticed. You smile at her, because you can hardly help it, and she steps closer to you, smiling wanly in return. You meet her halfway, and she takes your hand as you do hers, squeezing gently. You draw comfort from the touch, as does she, her smile strengthening.

"They're a strange pair, aren't they?" Mami asks.

"They are," you say with a sigh. You don't stop, gently tugging Mami towards Sayaka, Kyouko, and Yuma. "Are you OK, Mami?"

"I am," Mami says. She doesn't object to checking on your friends, sticking at your side as you head over.

"Good," you say, giving her a quick smile. You'll want to talk to her properly later about this whole thing, but if Mami says she's fine, then she is. You believe her, so for now, Sayaka and Yuma take priority, and you want to check on Kyouko, too.

Sayaka's managed to stand now, but she's still pale as she notices you approaching.

"I'm fine," she says. "I'm- I'm *fine*. That was just- just a lot. I'm fine, OK?"

The way she's still leaning on Kyouko, the way they're carefully stepping away from a small puddle of vomit, the way she's resolutely looking away from the spot the Soujus had been dismembered rather gives lie to *that* statement, you feel. But you're definitely not going to call her out on it, or at least not to her face.

"Alright," you say, nodding. "Yuma? Kyouko?"

"Yuma is..." Yuma's pale and clinging still to Kyouko's leg, and shaking just a bit. "Yuma will be OK."

Kyouko scowls at you, but offers a measured nod.

The first time Sayaka has seen this sort of violence, that's for sure. Yuma has *some* idea, the way Kyouko had been hurt by a Witch all the way back then, but even so, it can't be easy to see. You're not entirely sure for Mami or Kyouko, but both of them seem to be holding up alright.

"Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry about that," you say. "Just... wanted to shut them down fast, and locking them down wouldn't have worked." You take a breath. "For what it's worth, the Soujus seem to be fine and mostly unbothered, and I'm going to heal them up, too."

"Oh. Good?" Sayaka says, looking queasy. She swallows hard. "Why the heck can my clone *vomit*, anyway?"

"The magic probably cloned your body as it was at the time of making," Mami suggests. "Including what you ate, it would seem."

"Ugh," Sayaka groans, pulling herself upright and straightening fully. "I... sorry about that."

"Don't be ridiculous," you say, shaking your head. "*I'm* sorry. That was just... look, even if you *know* about how much punishment we can take, as magical girls, it's a hell of a leap to actually *witness* this sort of thing. Any normal person would be horrified. So yeah. *I'm* sorry, everyone."

"Y' won," Kyouko says gruffly, shaking out her slightly-bedraggled ponytail. "And none of *us* were hurt. That's a good win."

She cocks her head.

"Don't even hear any sirens coming our way either," she says, sounding satisfied. "Don't think anyone noticed."

"It went well enough," Mami agrees. She gives you a pointed look, though, softening it with a smile and a gentle squeeze of your hand, which you take to mean that she doesn't appreciate your implicit self-criticism.

"Right," Sayaka says, taking a deep breath and looking you square in the eye. "Right. Now what do we do?"

If you choose *not* to do the questioning right now in favour of other things, that's fine, but I decided to provide a small slate of obvious questions so that that doesn't have to be argued over. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

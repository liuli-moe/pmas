# Office Complex pt. 13

You nod sharply. Sunday's largely clear, and oh dear. That does remind you that you've only got two more weekends until Walpurgisnacht.

Which, admittedly, sounds like a long time. It's almost as long as you've been... Alive? Aware?

Well. Almost.

"*Sunday would be perfect,*" Mami tells Aoi.

"*Great!*" Aoi says. "*I'll call the Council, then. Morning or afternoon?*"

"*Ah, I believe that a private meeting with your group prior to the full Council meeting would be in order,*" Mami says, catching your eye again. You smile, gesturing towards Mami - she's doing great, and you trust her. "*And I believe that the afternoon would be best? Perhaps at two?*"

"*Two would be perfect - and we would have insisted on meeting you personally even if you hadn't requested it,*" Aoi says. "*It's not every day that we receive such exceptional visitors!*"

And oh, but isn't *that* just the slightest bit ominously suspicious, when you throw in the concerns of mind magic? Of course, it's *just* as reasonably the perfectly reasonable response of the slightly starstruck. It's not like you haven't run into a fair number of people utterly awed by Mami, you, or *both*.

Well. You're going loaded for bear, anyway.

"*We'll look forward to the meeting on Sunday, then,*" Mami says. She leans against you, tucking her head against your shoulder. "*Sabrina, did you want to raise anything?*"

"*Ah, yes, actually,*" you say. You *did* want to bring up the idea of detaching one of the Tokyo groups to police the others, among other things. "*On a more practical note, would it be acceptable if we wanted to look at hiring magical girls from Tokyo while we're there?*"

"*Certainly - if you have anything specific in mind, we could provide suggestions? If not, you'll have the opportunity to speak in person to all the groups come Sunday,*" Aoi says, and continues in a rather careful tone. "*It's not an uncommon notion, and in fact, I believe you ran into Miss Ueda under... related circumstances.*"

"*Yeah, I remember,*" you say. Ueda Noa, who'd been in Sendai during that little conflict. She'd been the one to first carry your message and offer to Tokyo, even. "*How is she, anyway?*"

"*I wouldn't know in any detail, but we haven't heard any complaints?*" Aoi says, a shrug all but audible in her mental voice.

"*Fair enough,*" you say. Too many magical girls in Tokyo for any one person to keep track of, you suppose. "*Anyway, that's all I wanted to ask, unless there's anything important we need to know before heading down to Tokyo? Mami?*"

"*Nothing that comes to mind,*" Mami says, raising her head off your shoulder to flash you a warm smile.

"*And nothing from me, either,*" Aoi says. "*So believe that concludes our business - we'll look forward to seeing you on Sunday.*"

"*Until then,*" Mami agrees, nodding.

"*See you on Sunday!*" you say, and end the call, smiling at Mami.

"All done?" Sayaka asks, already raising her hand. Madoka and Hitomi look up, curious, while Homura shuffles back a bit.

"Go ahead, Sayaka," Mami says.

"Right. Here goes..." Sayaka says.

You brace for it, grimacing at the *greasy* sensation of antimagic washing over you, like being splashed with oil. You're never going to get used to it, even if it's not directed at *you*.

Hah, there's another reason for Kirika's magic being the way it is. It's almost like it's specifically tailored to irritate you in particular, especially considering that Mami doesn't seem to have as severe a response to it, simply leaning into it like a brisk wind.

"OK, done," Sayaka says as the antimagic blast fades, giving you two a faintly concerned look. "How are you feeling?"

You inspect your memory for a second, suck in a sharp, shocked breath, and turn huge eyes on Mami. "I just remembered something *terribly* important and I can't believe that I forgot, even for the barest *fraction* of a second. It must have been the *vilest*, most terrible of magics to have made me forget, even for a second."

By the end of the sentence, you're standing, one hand to your breast and one hand dramatically outflung as if proclaiming grand oratory to some great crowd. Sayaka sits back, nudging Madoka and rolling her eyes as she picks up her chopsticks.

"What is it, Sabrina?" Mami asks, a barely-suppressed twitching to her lips.

"Sayaka, I must thank you a thousand times for saving me from that terrible fate," you say, and kneel in front of Mami, looking up at her earnestly. "Mami, you're awesome. And I want you to know tha- hey!"

You twist out of the way, and find an amused look and outstretched, post-flick finger leveled at you not by Sayaka, as you'd expected, but by *Hitomi*.

"Bad Sabrina," she says, and primly returns to eating delicately with her one good hand.

You giggle, grinning at Hitomi as you reclaim your seat next to Mami. "OK, but seriously. Thanks, Sayaka, for helping make sure. I don't *think* they did anything to my brain. Mami? Are you alright?"

"I am," Mami says, smiling and rewarding you with a kiss on the cheek. You wrap your arm around her, and she happily snuggles closer.

"Would we be able to tell if they did something to your brain?" Homura muses quietly.

"... Ouch, Homura. *Ouch.*" You clutch at your chest, giving her a betrayed look. Madoka giggles happily.

Homura shrugs, but she's smiling, just the tiniest bit.

"Anyway, so - Mami's set up a meeting with the Council for us for this Sunday afternoon," you say. "I'll be letting Miss Tsuruya and Kazumi know in a second, of course. Mami also arranged for us to meet Chiyoda first, and then the full Council for us to present our case."

Hitomi nods approvingly. "Sound thinking."

"Meeting *just* Chiyoda?" Sayaka asks. "Sounds a bit... worrying?"

"I thought so too," Mami offers. "They mentioned that they'd have insisted, even if we hadn't asked."

"There *is* perfectly reasonable cause for wanting a private meeting first," Hitomi notes. "It could, for example, just be that they wish to establish an initial stance before the full meeting."

Madoka worries at her lip. "Did they say anything else?"

"Nothing much other than pleasantries, and we didn't speak to Miss Toshimichi herself, just one of her teammates - one Shimada Aoi," Mami says. "Homura, I don't suppose you've heard of her before?"

Homura considers this, frowning slightly in thought. "I don't think so."

"That's, um, not really unusual," Madoka says, shaking her head. "I mean... Miss Toshimichi is apparently pretty reluctant to show herself *anyway*, I'm not surprised that someone else would be, um, answering the phone for her."

"Agreed," you say with a sigh. "But it leaves us with precious little information to work off of. Also, Sunday."

"What about Sunday?" Madoka asks.

"No, I was just thinking that I'm going to have to reschedule meeting some other teams for the rest of the week," you say, frowning. Kagoshima and Hozuki.

"I don't have information, but I have cake?" Hitomi offers. "Well... Sayaka's carrying it?"

"Yeah, I've got it," Sayaka says, grinning and producing a box that turns out to contain a chocolate cake.

"Oh, what's the event?" Mami asks, smiling.

"There isn't one," Hitomi says with a laugh. "My father thought it would be nice."

"Well, convey my thanks to him?" you say. And as the conversation descends into a flurry of echoed thanks and scrambling to get the cake dished out, Mami taking charge, you reach out by telepathy. Mami flashes you a smile as you include her, but she's busily dividing up the cake.

"*Hey Kazumi, Miss Tsuruya,*" you call. "*Got a moment?*"

"*Heya!*" Kazumi chirps happily. "*I'm free right now. Well, mostly. Oh, hi Mami!*"

"*As am I,*" Yuki says.

"*Hello, Kazumi,*" Mami says warmly.

"*Right! Kazumi, this is Tsuruya Yuki, from Fukushima, and Miss Tsuruya, this is Kazusa Michiru, from Asunaro,*" you say. "*As discussed, we're the three groups that will be forming a coalition to visit Tokyo.*."

"*Ahhhh. Hi, Miss Tsuruya!*" Kazumi chirps. "*Call me Kazumi!*"

"*It's good to make your acquaintance, Miss Kazumi,*" Yuki says politely. "*Has something come up with Tokyo, then?*"

"*Yup - we've finally nailed down a date with Tokyo - the coming Sunday afternoon. Well, I say we, but mostly it was Mami's awesomeness,*" you say. "*I hope it works for everyone?*"

"*Ah, Sunday? That's certainly doable,*" Yuki says. "*Arguably more so than Monday.*"

"*Works for me!*" Kazumi says. "*Gotta reschedule a bit of stuff, but... ahhh, no, it's fine.*"

"*Oh, sorry about that,*" you say. Sounds like you might have disrupted some plans?

"*No, no, it's fine,*" Kazumi says. "*Seriously. Was just planning on going out with everyone, but we can go out for dinner too.*"

"*Alright, if you're sure,*" you say. Mami rejoins you with two paper plates laden with cake - one for you, one for herself. You beam at her. "*Uh... I'll be arranging transport. By which I mean I can ferry everyone over to Tokyo?*"

"*That would be for the best,*" Yuki says.

"*Yup, sounds good!*" Kazumi says brightly.

"*Great!*" you say as you dig into the cake, savouring the rich bitterness of dark chocolate. "*See you on Sunday, then!*"

"This is *fantastic* cake. Not as good as Mami's, of course," you continue outloud, exchanging telepathic good-byes with Kazumi and Yuki.

"It's store bought," Hitomi says, chuckling. "So I should think so, on *both* counts."

"Fair enough!" you say with a laugh, and lean against Mami as you enjoy the cake and just let yourself relax with your friends, good-natured chatter and teasing washing over you. Mugin returns, cadging more treats from you and Sayaka. Lunch is almost over, but these moments of peace are worth savouring.

You consider reminding Mami that you're going to be bringing Sayaka off to train with Kyouko later today, but...

No.

Not now.

You don't want to have to stew on it for the rest of the school day, and you're *definitely* going to see her after school before heading to Kasamino, anyway. You have time now, and you'll have time *later*, to lavish her with the attention and the affection she deserves.

So you do just that, taking her hand in yours and sitting close enough that your legs and shoulders are pressing against each other, Mami's warmth a constant, present comfort to you as much as you hope *your* presence is for her.

Still, it's almost time.

"Hey, Homura?" you speak into a lull in conversation. "Could I have a private word before you head off for classes?"

Homura blinks, and nods at you.

"Speaking of which," Sayaka says, theatrically hopping to her feet and stretching. "I reckon it's time. See ya!"

"Mmmh!" Madoka says, beaming as she gets to her feet. "Was good to see you, Sabrina."

Hitomi dusts down her skirt as she stands, smiling. "I'll be heading to the hospital right after school today," she notes. "To get this cast off."

"Oh, that's fast," you say.

"Nothing but the best," Hitomi says with a wry quirk of her lips and a shrug.

"Hah. Fair enough," you say. "So I probably won't be seeing you later?"

"Perhaps," Hitomi says. "Admittedly, you're always at the school gate."

"True!" you say, grinning at Mami. You offer your hand to her, and let her pull herself to her feet.

"Later!" Sayaka says. She clicks her tongue, catching Mugin's attention, who caws and flutters back over to your bench.

"Still got my minder, I see," you say, amused.

"He seems to like you!" Sayaka says with a laugh. "I didn't actually tell him to follow you this time, just that we were leaving."

You snicker, gently rubbing Mugin's neck. "Well, off we go on more weird adventures, then."

Sayaka grins and snatches up Hitomi's lunchbox before scampering for the stairs. Hitomi huffs and follows, and you exchange farewells with Madoka who hurries off after her.

"... I'll be over there," Homura says, gesturing vaguely at the stairwell.

"Thanks, Homura," you say, turning a gentle smile on Mami. "I'll see you after school, alright? I promise."

"I know," Mami says. She steps forward, wrapping her arms around your waist and tucking her head under your chin. "I know, Sabrina."

You bury your nose in the golden thatch of her hair.

"I'm glad I found you," she murmurs. "And that you came with me, that first day. I don't... I don't know what would have happened, otherwise."

"You're stronger than you know," you murmur, trying not to think about things that weren't. "And I'm here *now*."

Mami laughs, burrowing a little closer. "I know," she says. "I know." She pulls back, and smiles at you. "I'll see you later, Sabrina."

"You will," you promise, giving her another gentle kiss on the cheek. "See you soon."

"See you soon," Mami murmurs, backing away. She keeps her eyes on you as she heads towards the stairwell, until she disappears past the wall.

Homura emerges a few moments later.

"Hey, Homura," you say. "Thank you for waiting."

"Not a problem," she murmurs, and transforms in that familiar blaze of amethyst light. You grin at her, and await that familiar stutter of the world that marks the transition in-

-to the bleached greys of her timestop. Homura's hand is warm on your wrist as you nudge her gently over to the bench.

"What's happening?" Homura asks as she sits.

"Well... first of all, it's a bit awkward, but uh, it occurs to me that this conversation might benefit from having Mami here?" you say. "I'm only going to touch lightly on Witch related matters."

"What do you want to talk about?" Homura asks, frowning slightly.

"Uh," you say, ticking the points off on your fingers. "First, Airi - as I said, I visited her today, and I need to update you. Second, Iowa. That's the big one that needs to be discussed with you *and* Mami, I think."

Homura considers this for a moment. "I can go and get her," she concludes, and tilts her head slightly. Her next words are reluctant. "... what about Miki Sayaka?"

Spoiler: Vote in abeyance

- [x] Offscreen: Fill her in on Airi's situation.
- [x] Ask Homura if she wants Mami included in discussions that don't touch the Witchbomb
- [x] Explain everything you have heard about Iowa's methodologies and tendencies, including Yuki's evaluation of them having clairvoyant-esque information and their noted travel path.
  - [x] There is small but significant chance that their "clairvoyant" is Kyubey, and you don't want them getting anywhere near Mitakihara. You've already gotten a price quote from Yuki in case you choose to buy their help with this and it's not unreasonable.
  - [x] Bring up that Homura herself is a likely target for a first-strike.
  - [x] You are very hopeful that Oriko's new magic will help with this problem.
  - [x] If you don't manage to neutralize Iowa group abroad within a moderate timeframe you will need to read Madoka and Hitomi in on their likely intentions and the threat they pose, because either of them being caught off guard would be far, far worse than them knowing.
- [x] Break. Don't leave timestop.

So I *swear* I meant to finish the update with all the stuff for Homura, but then she had to go and raise a pretty good point. Also, this lets me get in an early update. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

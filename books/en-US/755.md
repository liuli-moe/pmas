# Lowlife pt. 21

Your expression tightens, and you still for a moment. Mostly an act, but not *just* an act- you can feel the wave of anger and concern that races through you. You're *not* willing to accept a threat to the hostages.

You take a second to orient.

Your friends are safe, for the most part. Mami and the rest of Team Aleph are still on overwatch, Mika flitting around with Delta Team and the bears in tow. Sayaka's taken flight on her own, Kirika's making for the platform with Mami, that's fine. Yuki and her squad are on the deck, and they seem to be safe for the moment, though you can feel the seethe of Grief in Yuki's Soul Gem as she burns magic. That's fine - they're within your range, and you can keep everyone cleansed.

Yuma, Noriko, Akemi - *your* squad. They're fine, albeit separated from you. Fighting still, and they're being harassed by the... the wizard girl, you mentally tag her. There one second and gone the next, just enough to force your friends back to back to defend themselves. You'll get to that in a moment.

Where are the rest of the enemy? Discount Power Girl remains locked down in a giant blob of Grief, struggling still. You give her enough room to breathe but not enough to gain leverage - she might not need it, but it feels polite. Their antimage has been dropped off with Aleph, and you can sense Mami's ribbons binding her down - or, no, not quite Mami's ribbons. Sayaka's copy of them, alongside the sizzle of what must be Umika's magic.

Fine, and good.

The rest of the Iowa group, then. With a moment to breathe, you can place them now, the presence of their Soul Gems and their Grief burning bright in your mind's eye. Their hostages, too, now that they're not buried behind the nauseating *crawl* of antimagic.

Good. You know where they are, and that means you can act. You'd been relying on Oriko, for her overview of the battlefield and her insight to call out patterns and to coordinate, but now *you're* in the perfect position to act.

A second to orient, you'd told yourself. That second is up, and it's time to put thought to action. Your Grief surges, stirring in anticipation to match the anger on your face, and the worry that's only half feigned. You make a show of the anger, letting Grief darken the air around you and stir your coat as you clench your fists, buying yourself a couple seconds more to arrange things with your friends.

The simmering fury that pulls your face into a grimace is only *mostly* for show. An unmistakable threat has been presented to the hostages, and you will *not* let that stand. You've been holding back, keeping to the niceties of not dismembering or Gem-snatching. Not all of your friends know about the truth of Soul Gems, but if it's between that and lives on the line...

"*Hold up for a moment, everyone,*" you snap over telepathy, telepathy flowing at the speed of thought. "*Yuma, Miss Saito, Miss Watanabe, I'll be with you in a sec, everyone else - they *don't* have me locked down, and I'll break out in a moment, and I'm gonna see if I can shut down their teleportation. Miss Tsuruya, I'm going to break the ship, I think. It's too much of an advantage for them.*"

"*Agreed,*" Yuki says, annoyed frustration bleeding into her mental voice. "*The captain has been resisting my attempts very well.*"

"*Are you sure, Sabrina?*" Mami asks you. You can hear the worry in her tone, and it instantly brings you up short.

"*I'm sure, Mami,*" you tell her and her alone. "*I'll be out soon, um, I have a plan to share with everyone.*" With the same mental breath, you continue on the general channel. "*On that note, there's a girl with a green bodysuit, I'm pretty sure she's a power enhancer,*" you say - you'd thought she might be a teleporter, but after a moment's thought, power enhancement makes more sense. "*And she's boosting the captain. Keep an eye out.*"

"*We saw her earlier,*" Sayaka says. "*She was with the captain, and I think she linked up with their flier for a bit.*

"*Right... We know where the hostages are,*" you say. "*I'm going to break the ship and try something to limit their mobility in a moment. It's gonna feel Witchy, but it will be *my* work. Yuma, Miss Watanabe, Miss Saito, I'll link up with you when that's done. Uh... Sayaka, Miss Tsuruya, Kazumi, can we focus on freeing the hostages? I'll extract my team, get out, get an overview, and join you as soon as possible.*"

"*Got it,*" Sayaka grunts. "*Miss Nakano, can you get us in position?*"

"*With pleasure,*" Mika says.

"*What do you mean by breaking the ship?*" Akemi asks, her mental voice tight and strained.

"*I'm going to tear it apart and see if I can keep them from reforming it,*" you say. "*I have *zero* interest in playing their game. Don't worry about footing, I'll keep that handled.*"

"*When you're ready, Miss Vee,*" Yuki says, tone even once more.

Grief, Grief, and more Grief. You're giving the Iowa girls Grief, hah. But still, you have more at your disposal, the air around you thickening yet more until it's a visible haze of deep, unsettling purple, a roiling fog bank that surges and eddies around you. More crystallizes around you, plates forming armour that... you didn't really feel was necessary, but the twinge of your broken ribs suggests that it might be a good backup to have.

Eh, not like it slows you down, anyway.

But that's not where the majority of your Grief goes. Even as you focus a fraction of your intention on shaping the Grief you'd enchanted, you guide still more until it pervades the ship, an invisible, cloying cloud that billows and permeates every square millimeter, every square nanometer of the Iowa. As far as you can reach, anyway, the bow- and sternmost bits are just out of reach.

"Well, Miss Vee?" That voice crackles over the speakers again. "Would you like to talk?"

Talk, hah. Even now you can feel your friends being harassed. Two magical girls now, a new one teleporting in - or perhaps three, really, given how much they lean on the teleportation for effect the hit and run.

Well, you're going to put a stop to that. You reach mentally for the enchanted Grief, as mutable and fickle as reality itself to the touch of magic. You hold your intent for a fragment of time, just a moment between seconds, and you brand your will upon the world.

"*On zero, everyone,*" you murmur.

You wait for the confirmations as your eyes slide shut, and for the countdown to end. A sliver of attention focuses on shaping the enchanted Grief along semi-familiar and yet *different* patterns. Interdiction. Control. Not *that* different, the forms sliding into place. Distant for now, leashed by your will and held in hammerspace, but unmistakable and ready.

You'd debated starting this whole thing with a show of force, and there remains... value in the idea of intimidation.

"I suppose I never did open with a statement of intent," you murmur. Your voice doesn't issue from your mouth, instead vibrating from the very walls of the ship. "*Surrender*."

"*Zero,*" you whisper to your friends. They explode into motion, and so do you.

The first thing you do is to drop the anchor - and anchor it is, because what else would it be? Nothing changes, to your eye or anyone elses', but you can *feel* it, an oppressive pressure that blankets the world and screams at the back of your mind of *Wiiiitch*.

Distantly, you can sense one of the Iowa girls fall to her knees, clutching her head and dragging another down with her.

Your smile contains no humour at all. You can sense your friends moving: with a bit of luck, you'd timed it well enough to trap both their attackers with Yuma and Noriko and Akemi. Yuma, who is *definitely* Kyouko's student, proceeds to revoke wizard-girl's kneecap privileges as Noriko turns on the other. You sense Sayaka diving in for the attack, the rest of her squad in tow and Mika at their backs.

And so, with Grief already in place, it's time to do *your* part.

You unmake the Iowa. Every bolt, every weld, every rivet. Every press-fitted plate, every armour segment, every pipe and wire and gear and fixture from radar mast to keel. The turrets rise from their well with a groan, the shells and propellant set aside. It's almost musical, a cascade of twangs and groans as you forcibly part metal from metal, lifting each section free until the ship resembles a diagram from a child's how-it-works book, exploded into nice, tidy segments for easy labelling.

The citadel, especially. The heavy armour means very little to you as you part the walls and open it to the skies beyond, the flinches of the girls within obvious in your senses. You hope that the Iowa girls don't do anything stupid before you shut them down.

Sunlight filters in from the gaps, fresh air and warm sun mingling with the smell of oil and metal.

At the back of your mind, you track your friends. Kyouko's whoop cuts through the shriek of disassembly as she dives through what used to be the command tower of the Iowa. Deck plates slide apart at your behest, enough traction for her to ping-pong off the walls on her way down, her spear flicking out to redirect her path. Sayaka plunges after her, the rest of their squad following.

Yuma's arm is broken - *shattered*. Wizard-girl finds herself trapped, mired in grief as you lock her down. Akemi's magic blazes bright around her, but her partner-

The floor goes out from under her, taken apart by your Grief. She scrabbles for footing, bouncing off thin air to grapple at a Noriko with a dagger. The other Noriko swings, and you understand. Some kind of rebound, or backlash magic, and despite Noriko's shimmering bladework, she's forced to retreat as cuts open up on her arms and torso, but then *Akemi* strides forward, footing certain on Grief plates you form ahead of her.

You unfurl Grief around her, because you don't need to be there to act. Yuma's already healed up, the glow of her magic lighting up in your mind's eye as she extends it to Noriko, too. And then Homura's there.

Without hesitation, she puts two shots into the attacker's torso, and a third into her arm, smashing aside the dagger. It buys Akemi time to gather magic, and when her magic flares to life, a deep, rosy hue that glows through the gaps in the disassembled bulkheads, the girl crumples.

What-

You don't understand what Akemi just did, but you'll take it. You wrap the fallen Iowa girl in yet more Grief, piling on layer after layer to immobilize her along with her partner.

"*Let's get out of here!*" you bark.

"*She's tough - it won't hold her for long!*" Akemi snaps.

"*I'll get her to Kirika,*" you respond. "*C'mon!*" And to Homura, you add, "*Thanks, Homura. That could have turned out badly.*"

You're already rocketing upwards, wings unfurling once more. Homura and Yuma and Noriko and Akemi rise with you, borne on discs of Grief as you punch up through the decks, and in your wake, you drag three blobs of Grief. Three of the Iowa girls, freshly captured, to join the first - their antimage.

Mami soars to meet you on golden wings.

The rest of the Iowa girls-

Six of them. Just six left, just past half their number. They'd retreated to the citadel, the deepest, most heavily armoured part of the ship, pulling the hostages with them, but now, what used to be a dense, armoured warren of rooms is now an open plain, deck shattered and bulkheads rent. The hostages -the *locals*- seem... dazed. Fear gnaws at you for a split second, swept away by the realization that you can sense their Soul Gems. They're alive.

Your lips peel off your teeth as you feel the captain's magic surging, just enough to keep a deck beneath their feet and a weapon to her hand to face your friends. Greeny -their power enhancer- blazes in your mind's eye, a nova of unrelenting power as they turn to face your friends dropping from above.

Kyouko leads the charge with a yell and the streaking jabs of her spear, Sayaka a flowing shadow at her side with sabers. Kazumi has rifles reminiscent of Mami's, conjured from the air and already roaring out shots.

That poncho girl's there to meet them, her magic sparking turquoise. Emerald twines through her magic, stoking it ever higher, and-

Kazumi's shots miss.

Kyouko's strikes go wide.

Sayaka gets a backhand. You catch her with Grief, offering footing and support as her hand dives beneath her cloak.

Two of the Iowa girls blink out of existence. You suck in a breath, eyes widening. You'd disabled their teleportation, so it shouldn't be *possible*.

No.

Her Soul Gem. You can sense it blazing bright, still right there in the middle of your accreting Grief, but-

"*Stealth!*" you warn. "*Two of them, I don't have enough Grief in the area so watch out!*"

Priorities. You need to get the hostages out of there, and you need to protect them- you flood them with grief, dense enough to shield them and to snatch them from behind the Iowa girls.

The captain levels her pistol *at the hostages*-

You slam her aim away, and-

Sayaka lashes out with a yell-

Her finger tightens, and the blast-

Grief. *More* Grief, stolen from other tasks and congealing out of the air around the pistol, around her *hand*-

You focus the blast away, a burning column of magic and force that shudders through the afternoon air, a visible shockwave pulsing through the air and incinerating a hole through the side of the disassembled Iowa. The Iowa's own main guns, condensed down into a *pistol* that sears shadows through the disassembled plates, and-

Moe's there. Speed in shadow, striking at the captain with a flipping, rising kick that connects under her chin. Kyouko leaps into the fray with a yell, then pushes off to dodge jagged shards of ice slashing past her from thin air. Moe folds around what must be an invisible kick.

The captain lands, blood flowing freely from her mangled wrist -there's nothing *left* of her hand- for just a second before it reforms. The *other* Iowa girl. A healer, it transpires, but then Sayaka's on her with a battlecry and lightning crackling in her veins.

"*I require a backstop,*" Sasami murmurs into your mind.

"*On it!*" you bark back. More Grief to the task, as you estimate angles and positions. A solid block, fuzzing darker than black to soak up Sasami's laser, on the opposite side of the Iowa from her, and barely a heartbeat after you finish it, Sasami fires.

A second sun scorches through the sky, an incandescent bar that sears into your retinas and leaves you blinking away afterimages.

Yuki drops through the hole as the Iowa girls reel, Mirai, and the bears slamming down after her. Kaoru plummets with a yell, driving into a descending kick that seems to connect with nothing at all and slamming something into the deck.

In the same instant, Yuki pivots and draws a nodachi taller than she is from beneath her cloak, the curved blade carving through the air and stilling, a mirror of Kyouko's blade, seemingly trapping nothing between them.

The two girls shimmer into visibility. Yuki has her blade *right* under the chin of one of the girls, and you can sense her swallowing as she carefully raises her hands in an unmistakable gesture of surrender.

Mirai's bears storm forward with growls rattling low in their throats, but too little, too late, as the nauseating *grease* of antimagic floods from Sayaka, smothering the battlefield.

Movement stills, and slowly, finally, the Iowa's captain raises her hands in surrender.

You exhale, and take stock.

I am really, *really* sorry for how long this update took. Hopefully, it'll be the last one to be delayed this much.

Two minor details that didn't quite fit the flow: Mika's caught the two far ends of the Iowa that *you* aren't supporting, and Mami's still flying to meet you. That last segment of combat took place over maybe thirty seconds, and her flight isn't that fast!

She'll catch up in a bit. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

Now, with that aside, I want to bring up something ahead of time.

The next logical thing that's going to come up, inevitably, is discussing what to do with the Iowa girls after interrogating them. And it's probably something that might spark some disagreement. But... look.

2020 has not been a kind year. The world's kind of horrible. Don't *add* to that. So even if you disagree with your fellow questers, just remember that there's another person behind that screen. Be kind to each other.

# Undue Alarm pt. 14

"Sakura, *stop!*" Akiko yells. The teleporter doesn't seem to care, though, seemingly concentrating on her magic instead while Rin struggles fruitlessly against the teleporters grip on her arm.

Her Soul Gem. It's mounted on a hairclip, much like Mami's is.

Reaching out with your powers, you yank at the Grief in the Soul Gem. It comes free easily, like every other cleansing you've done - *no!* You bear down on it, even as Sakura and Rin begin to *shift*, and the Grief flashes into a solid mass, a band snug around the Soul Gem, and you *pull*-

A short scream, cut off-

A Soul Gem, along with a few strands of brown hair, smacks into your outstretched hand-

Rin and Sakura disappear, their bodies *shifting* in a eye-bending manner with a '*vwwp*'-

A spike of Grief appearing in Sakura's Soul Gem-

-and *one* magical presence blinks into existence on the edge of your Grief senses, about two hundred meters away. The presence -Rin, you think?- falls and tumbles across the ground-

Sakura's Soul Gem is still in your hand-

"No!" Akiko yells, staring at the place where the pair used to be, one hand outstretched in a fruitless grab. "*No,* damn it!" She whirls on you. "Miss Sabrina, do yo-"

She catches sight of the brown Soul Gem in your hand, and the words die half spoken. "Oh, *no*."

There was at least one way you could have stopped the teleport. This, uh, wasn't it. On the bright side, you *did* disrupt it.

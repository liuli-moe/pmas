# On a Rail pt. 7

Ah, well, the junkyard it is. It *is* Mami's spot, after all, and you're with Mami right now.

You let Mami take half a step of lead, bounding after her with what's becoming practiced ease. You're getting much better at this - though your roof hopping still is still rather more parkour than Mami's pure, flowing élan. You roll, and you vault, and you somehow get where you're going without a single strand of hair out of place nor picking up a single speck of dirt, but there's not one trace of *elegance* to it.

Eh.

It works.

You arc into the junkyard, soles slewing to a halt on the sandy ground. Mami barely raises any dust at all, primly patting her skirt down.

When she looks up, seeking your presence, you give her a warm smile. "Ready to begin?" you ask.

"Mmmhm," she agrees, taking a step closer to you, close enough that her hip bumps against yours.

With a laugh, you pull her into a hug. "Alright, then," you say. "I think... well, as I said, I want to figure out ways in which I could perhaps extend my range."

Mami nods, her hairdrills bobbing against your shoulder. It tickles a little. "What do you need me to do?"

"Well," you say. "Could you move to the other side of the junkyard? You'll need to be on the edge of my control range, and keep an eye on what happens. I'll stay in contact by telepathy, alright?"

Mami nods. "Alright," she agrees. You give her another quick squeeze before releasing her from the hug, and she backs off, walking to the other end of the long, sandy yard. She has to weave around a few rusting old cars and refrigerators, but she manages to keep in line of sight.

You roll your neck, sending a handful of marbles to bob along beside Mami, hunting for the edge of your range. "*There,*" you murmur into her mind as you stop the marbles at the very borderline. "That's*my limit.*"

"*Alright.*" Mami nods, stopping and turning to face you. You give her a wave, which she returns happily.

By the looks of it, she's inspecting the Grief marbles rather curiously, poking at them with a finger.

"*Mami,*" you warn. "*I'm going to make some light. Tell me if you see it?*" At Mami's assent, you do just that, an exhale and a touch of mental focus bringing forth gentle illumination from one of the Grief marbles. You can see the little floating sphere light up from where you are, soft light visible even against the rising sun.

"*I can see it,* Mami confirms.

Your eyebrows shoot up, a smile splitting your face. If *light* is visible, then *coherent* light is - and that means *lasers*. Interesting.

"*Sabrina?*" Mami calls into your mind, worried concern in her mental voice.

... You're vibrating. All but vibrating with excitement, making a high pitched 'eeeeeeeee' that Mami can probably hear.

"*Sorry,*" you respond. "*Just excited. OK, um, next test. You need polarised safety goggles of some kind, and we need physical shields. Um, I'd make you goggles, um, full face masks would be better, but you're out of range. Damn, I didn't think about that, I didn't reall-*"

"*It's alright, Sabrina,*" Mami says. Squinting at her, you notice her reaching behind her and producing a pair of sunglasses, unfurling them with a snap and putting them on.

"*... why do you have sunglasses?*" you ask.

Mami shrugs. "*Sunglasses are useful.*"

"*... but sunglasses are not protection,*" you say. "*Hm... Since I want to try and laser something, Mami, why don't you come back here? We can both hunker down behind a shield or something.*"

"*Alright,*" Mami agrees, hurrying over. She immediately tucks herself against your side. "S-sorry."

You wrap your arms around her. "Nothing to apologise for," you say. "See, I'm going to try and weaponise it next, so I'd feel better if you were safe with me."

"O-oh," Mami says. She hesitates for a long moment, before finally adding, "Thank you."

You poke her on the nose. "You're important to me," you tell her. "Never forget that."

"A-alright," she says.

You take a breath. "Anyway. Let's get behind some cover, and..." you squint down 'range'. "I'll try making an infrared beam and destroy that, uh... I think that's an old engine block over there?"

Mami squints, too. Or at least you *think* she does. She's still wearing the sunglasses. "Alright. We need to take cover, right?"

"Yup," you agree. "Uhh... around the back here." You tow Mami behind a large pile of random scrap metal and mouldering old tires. Grief forms a small seat, just large enough for both you and Mami to sit on - *out* of line of sight of the target. More Grief forms matte, non-specular walls, since reflections from high intensity light *can* blind just as well.

Mami sits beside you, tucking her head on your shoulder.

"OK, here we go," you mutter, mostly to yourself. "Test two: high intensity infrared light, focused into a beam." You bite your lip, considering. "Collimated, *coherent* light, emitted from Grief marble."

An exhale. You focus. Collimated, coherent light... you can do that. In your mind's eye and that odd *other* sense, you can feel the light drawing across the surface of the sphere like a shutter closing, until there's only a pencil thick beam left that hazes towards the invisible spectra of infrared.

The air heats. Even from this far away, you can *feel* the thermal bloom slicing through the morning chill. A sharp hiss heralds an acrid, burning smell making its way through the air to you.

... Success?

You kill the beam and dissolve the bunker, poking your head up around the rusting steel. Mami stands too, peering at the...

... well...

It's not an engine block. Not any more.

Nor is the sandy ground strictly speaking *ground* any more.

The pile of slag that used to be an engine block is still glowing. Faint *pings* reach you from the cooling metal - and sparkly, glassy bits of ground.

You stare, a wide, *wide* grin splitting your face. "Yessssss," you hiss.

Mami beams at you. "That's amazing, Sabrina!"

You grin right back at her, all but bouncing on your feet. "Yeah, it is! I think..." You hurry over to examine the puddle of cooling metal. "It's definitely outside my range."

Mami smiles at you, though there's a little edge of worry to it.

You pull her into a hug. "Hm..."

"Sabrina?" Mami asks, looking up at you.

"No, just thinking," you say. "I can't move Grief out of my range, but... this worked?"

Mami chews on her lip for a moment. "I... This is a guess, Sabrina, but I think that, um, strictly non-magical effects can exit your range. But maybe magical ones can't?" She hesitates for a while longer, something clearly on the tip of her tongue.

"Mami?" you prompt.

"No, no, I-" she turns a hopeful gaze on you. "Would you consider giving the laser a name? If you use it?"

You laugh. "Of course," you say. "Do you have something in mind?"

"Um..." Mami says, brightening. "Um. What's Italian for 'light'? Lux?"

"'Luce', I think," you say.

Mami nods. "What about... 'Luce Finale'?" she suggests, accompanying it with a blinding, hopeful smile.

You can't help but smile back."'Final light'?" you ask. "I don't think it's that... imposing."

"Attack names need to be *impressive*!" Mami says with an adamant shake of her head. "And they need to be *grand*! They need to have gravitas and they *should* be imposing!" And then her sudden conviction melts away, leaving an uncertain, worried girl in its wake. "U-um. If that's alright?"

Spoiler: Vote in abeyance

- [x] Create your grief orchestra near the edge of your range. Ask Mami if she can hear it.
- [x] Physically toss something with grief past the edge of your range. See if it behaves normally.
- [x] Regroup, and ask Mami on *her* thoughts on how the effects behaved. See if she has any suggestions or insights - both in terms of what the underlying principles might be, and in how the observed behaviors can be made useful.

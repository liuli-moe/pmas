# Lowlife pt. 1

You awaken to the sound of rain.

It's cold outside. The distant rumble of thunder rolls from time to time, drowning out the steady *pitter-patter* of raindrops drumming against the window, accompanied by lightning which crackles through the clouds and peeks through the gap in the curtains. The chill creeps in through the glass, seeping into the walls and into the air.

But it's warm here. Here, under the blankets, with Mami curled up against your back, arm and leg wrapped possessively around you. Warmer still is the sheer contentment of a job well done: One more friend for Mami, one more friend for *you*, and the Holy Quintet back together for the first time - with a few extras.

You feel Mami shifting on the bed, her hand working out of the blanket and finding its way to your hair, running slowly through the strands.

"... are you purring?" Mami murmurs after a while.

"... No," you deny.

Mami giggles, and presses her cold, cold nose to the back of your neck.

"*Geh*," you grumble. Then, softer, "Did I wake you?"

"Sort of, but it's alright," Mami murmurs. She cuddles closer to you, quiet for too long before she speaks again. "I've got more to wake up in the morning for, now."

"Oh," you say, because what *can* you say to something like that? "I'm glad."

"Mm," Mami says, and promptly yawns, wide and loud. Right by your ear, too. "Besides, we slept early, even though it's Saturday."

"So it is," you say, though some part of you is itching to get up and at 'em already. Admittedly, what you have planned today does rather determine on others: you're not getting any training done without Kyouko and Sayaka awake.

"You have such nice hair," Mami mumbles into said hair.

"Not next to you I don't," you say. "Mine's always a mess."

"It suits you," Mami says.

"Because *I'm* a mess?" you say, teasing.

"But you're *my* mess," Mami says with a low, quiet giggle.

"Damn straight I am," you say.

Conversation lapses after that, Mami's fingers combing slowly through your hair. A scrap of Grief twitches aside the curtains enough for you to see the miserably grey skies beyond, still pouring rain.

Man, they weren't kidding about with the forecast last night, were they? It's a good thing you *know* that Walpurgisnacht isn't due yet, or you'd have cause to be worried - and even if Kyouko would have found proper shelter for herself and Yuma last night, you're oddly glad that Mami had convinced them to come home with you.

Speaking of whom, you can still sense them out in the living room, sound asleep and dead to the world.

"What are we doing today, Sabrina?" Mami murmurs. "I know you had plans, but given the rain..."

"I was wondering if training in the rain might be a good idea," you respond. "If nothing else, I know that Walpurgisnacht is accompanied by a storm. And well... I'm hoping the rain slackens by afternoon, then we can go shopping."

"If not, there's always the train," Mami offers, and laughs quietly. "I don't think anyone would turn down a shopping trip, really, even if we have to brave the rain for it."

"Ah, that's a good point," you say. "And dinner with the Shizukis tonight, mustn't forget that."

"Mmm," Mami agrees. "It's a... remarkable coincidence that Mrs Shizuki just happened to have known a magical girl when she was young."

"I'm starting to believe little and less in sheer *coincidence*," you grumble.

"Mmmnm," Mami says.

"Should we get up and start making breakfast soon?" you muse.

"In... other times, I'd have been up already," Mami says. Her tone is quiet and contemplative, solemn, but not exactly sad. "Patrolling the city, and... searching."

"Ah," you say, reaching up to close your hand over Mami's. *Searching for what?* you don't ask, because the answer is heartbreakingly simple, and you already know it.

"But now\..." Mami shakes her head, her head brushing against your hair. "It's different." A touch of light humour enters her voice, then: "And in any case, it's *Saturday*. Our friends won't be up yet."

You laugh, and snuggle back against Mami. "That's true. That's very true."

"That said... perhaps we *should* arrange some patrols," Mami notes. "Even if Homura has been doing her diligence, we shouldn't be relying on her to cover our duty. We're a team, after all."

"And we wouldn't want it claimed that we were shirking our duties, either," you agree, leaving it... unmentioned who or *what* might claim you were being negligent.

"Mmm," Mami hums. "But that's for later."

There are worse ways to spend a Saturday morning than lazing around on a bed and chatting slowly about nothing in particular.

Eventually, by mutual, unspoken agreement, you roll out of bed and wash up before converging in the kitchen, tiptoeing past a sleeping Kyouko. Yuma's curled up on top of her, Kyouko's arm wrapped protectively around her adopted-in-all-but-name little sister.

... Kyouko snores.

Mami presses a minty kiss to your cheek as you join her in the kitchen. You beam at her.

"Good morning," she says.

"Good morning!" you say. "Should we wake Kyouko up for breakfast?"

"Not until we actually have breakfast ready," Mami says. "And in any case, the smell of food will probably awaken her."

"Hah," you say. You were... well, you'd rather make sure she's *awake* before you launch into your morning routine, if only to avoid unfortunate stabbings from startled redheads. "Alright. What's for breakfast..."

And the answer to that, at Mami's suggestion, is a traditional Japanese breakfast: rice, miso soup, some tuna broiled in the oven, and some pickled vegetables to round it out and add some tartness to the meal. And in precise concordance with Mami's prediction, you sense motion from Kyouko just as the savoury fragrance of cooking fish starts to waft towards the living room.

Mami beams at you, bumping her hip gently against yours as she departs for the dining table with laden tray in hand. You can sense Kyouko stumbling blearily over to the bathroom, with an equally sleepy Yuma attached to her leg.

Kyouko wanders out of the bathroom and over to the table just as you finish setting out breakfast, looking more alert - Yuma less so, however.

"Good morning, Kyouko," Mami says, smiling warmly.

"G'morning," Kyouko grumbles, rumpled and grumpy as she makes sure Yuma sits properly on a chair. "... thanks."

"You're very welcome," Mami says. You take the seat beside her, clapping your hands together.

"Itadakimasu\~" you say happily. Kyouko barely spares a breath to echo you before digging in, chopsticks moving with lightning speed - in stark contrast with Yuma, who's grazing her way through breakfast while staring around the apartment with bright-eyed interest.

Really, you're not sure what she finds so interesting about the place. It's a lovely home, certainly, but it's not like it's changed from last night, either.

"Anyway, Kyouko - mind if I include you and Yuma in... well, we do this sort of morning chat," you say. "In our friend group?"

Kyouko gives you a long, steady stare, stuffing her mouth with rice. Yuma tugs at her sleeve, looking up at her with huge, soulful eyes, and Kyouko crumbles instantly. "Sure, what the fuck ever," she grunts.

"Great," you say, sharing a grin with Mami. "Well, then..."

You take a deep breath, mostly to prepare yourself mentally than anything else.

"*Gooooooooood morning Mitakihara!*" you crow. Across the table, Kyouko closes her eyes for a brief second, face turning upwards as if praying for deliverance. Yuma practically bounces in her chair, eyes shining.

"*You're lucky I woke up early today,*" Sayaka grumbles.

"*It's nine, Sayaka,*" Hitomi says, gently chiding.

"*On a *Saturday*,*" Sayaka complains. "*Madoka, back me up here.*"

"*It's a Saturday,*" Madoka says loyally.

"*... good morning,*" Homura allows, apparently ignoring all the byplay.

"*Have you looked outside today?*" Sayaka grumbles. "*It's freaking funeral weather. It is *not* a good morning.*"

"*Suck it up, wondergirl,*" Kyouko drawls. "*Bit of rain won't hurt ya.*"

The mental conversation goes silent. Kyouko gives you a defiant look, to which you only respond with a placid smile.

"*Huh. Didn't expect you'd get dragged into this too,*" Sayaka says. "*'morning, Kyouko.*"

"*Ah... it's very nice to meet you?*" Madoka ventures.

"*Everyone, this is Sakura Kyouko,*" you say, discreetly taking Mami's hand under the table and squeezing gently. "*An old friend of Mami's. And Kyouko's student, Chitose Yuma.*"

"*Hello!*" Yuma says brightly. "*Big sis and I are staying with Mami and Sabrina now!*"

"*Ah, I see!*" Hitomi says. "*A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Sakura.*"

"*Yeah, yeah, nice to meet you too,*" Kyouko says gruffly, eyeing daggers at you. Eyeing spears, maybe. Really, you don't know what she's complaining about, other than out of sheer obstinacy born of aggravated tsundereness.

You grin back.

"*Are we still up for shopping today, considering the weather?*" Hitomi asks.

"*Ahhh, c'mon, a bit of rain won't hurt, right?*" You can *hear* Sayaka's grin as she echoes Kyouko's words. "*It's been ages since we got to do a proper thing, and this time we've got more people.*"

"Shopping? Seriously?" Kyouko asks out loud.

"Hey, shopping's great," you say. "... as long as we keep Madoka away from the furniture store. And you don't *have* to come, if you don't want to, though maybe you could buy some new clothes if you want?"

"*If everyone's still up for it, I don't see why not? I'm still up for helping with homework afterwards, too,*" you offer telepathically. "*And ah... Mami, Homura, Sayaka, Kyouko, Yuma - would you guys be up to some more training this morning?*"

"Nothing wrong with how I look," Kyouko says with a sniff, and returns to eating.

"Perhaps Yuma could use some new clothes?" Mami offers with a gentle smile. "But as Sabrina says, there's no pressure for you to come along. We can figure something out later."

"*Mmmmaybe not me, sorry?*" Sayaka says. "*Gotta get some more work done. You guys can go ahead, though!*"

"*I can be there,*" Homura says.

"*Training in the morning, until lunch, then shopping, and a homework session?*" Mami summarizes. "*Unless anyone has any objections?*"

And as has become habit (I've got to stop posting so late I'm spacing out) I forgot to call the chapter last post. There ends Office Complex, and here begins Book 2, Chapter 15: Lowlife!

(And no, 'lowlife' isn't referring to Kyouko here. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V"))

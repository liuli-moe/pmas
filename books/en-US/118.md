# Direct Intervention pt. 56

You grab the bottle of water, tossing it at her. She flinches, raising her remaining, still broken arm to catch it, but the bottle freezes in midair between the two of you. Hesitantly, she reaches out and plucks the bottle from the air, before laboriously clamping the bottle between her knees and screwing the top off with one hand.

You look at Homura while Oriko struggles with the bottle, and she frowns unhappily in response to your cocked head. Silently, you hold up a finger, and raise the reel of thread connecting Oriko to the timestop in the other hand - *we'll talk without Oriko*.

Slowly, hesitantly, Homura nods.

From the way Oriko guzzles the water in greedy gulps, without the expected refined manners you'd expect of her, she really needed the drink. While she does, you begin speaking again. "Yes, I would have listened. Maybe not taken you at face value, but I would have at least paid attention, and taken you seriously."

You let the thread reel fall from your hand, and Oriko is frozen mild gulp. Raising your hands to your head, you close your eyes and begin massaging your temples - this headache about what to do with Oriko is perhaps a little more literal than you'd hope.

"Whatever this new thing is... The way Oriko talks about it, Walpurgisnacht is barely a footnote to it," you mutter, without opening your eyes.

"You believe her?" Homura bites the words out.

"I don't know. I'm pretty sure *she* believes that what she's saying is real," you reply, opening your eyes to fix Homura with a steady gaze. "And really, *something* spooked her, that she's acting so differently."

Homura frowns severely at you.

"And we know next to *nothing* about it," you continue. "Her visions could be useful... But she and Kirika harming anybody is unacceptable."

"Why are you arguing for her?" Homura demands. "You have the information you wanted."

"Precognition is a... powerful asset, going forward," you say. "If we give her an outlet, let her feel she's doing her part... I *think* we can keep her under control. Under house arrest, maybe."

"*She killed Madoka,*" the time traveller *snarls*. "That loop might have *worked*."

~~You could always point out that *Homura* also killed Madoka, once. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")~~

# A Red Letter Day pt. 24

"Talk to her," you murmur to Mami, smiling. You hesitate for a second, and boot Homura, Oriko, and Kirika from the mental conversation, mouthing 'sorry' to them.

Homura blinks very slowly at you, managing to look faintly nonplussed without actually *changing* her expression one iota. Kirika, on the other hand, just rolls her eyes and flashes you a thumbs up, while Oriko nods.

Kazusa seems to notice the booting, though. "*Hey, who was that? Mami?*"

"*A-ah, some friends,*" Mami manages.

"*Oh, that's great!*" Kazusa says. She's *bubbly*. "*All worried about you, I guess? Hm, is someone still there? Hi!*"

"*Hi!*" you say. "*I'm Sabrina, it's nice to meet you. Sorry, I hope you don't mind?*"

"*No, no, it's fine!*" Kazusa says. Well, Michiru, to use her first name. "*Miss Tomoe? Are you OK?*"

Mami takes a deep, shuddering breath, and smiles. At *you*, not conveyed in that odd, barely-there impression over telepathy. "*I think so,*" she says. "*It *has* been a while, hasn't it?*"

"*It has!*" Michiru agrees. "*Oh! I have a proper team now, Miss Tomoe! We call ourselves the Pleiades Saints. I've taught them everything I learned from you.*"

"*I've heard,*" Mami says, nodding. You clasp her hand between both of yours, giving her an encouraging smile. She's got this.

"*Do you remember Kaoru and Umika?*" Michiru enthuses. "*They became magical girls, too! Umika is hoping to get her book published soon, she found an editor, and she says she wants to buy us a bigger house! Though... the three of us already live together, anyway, more or less.*"

"*That's good,*" Mami says. "*Was that the book you showed me a part of... last time?*" Her expression falls a little.

"*Ah, a different one,*" Michiru says, sounding proud. "*Um, kind of? You know how she is about writing, she rewrote so much of it!*"

"*That's cool!*" you say, trying to suppress the worry in your voice. As far as you know, Michiru Witches out on the day Umika's first book debuts, so that's your timeline. Then again, Michiru doesn't seem to show any strain of carrying too much Grief. "*What's the book title? Maybe we could pick up a copy here.*"

"*Oh, it isn't out yet!*" Michiru says. "\*It will be soon, though, it's called \*The Sky of Seven Stars."

"*Like the Pleiades constellation?*" you ask, quirking an eyebrow.

"*That's the idea!*" Michiru replies. "*Write what you know, Umika said.*"

"*Sounds about right,*" you agree, smiling faintly. You check on Mami. She's listening avidly, soaking it all in despite the biting, tired grief on her face.

"*Oh, Pleiades, like your group?*" Mami asks.

"*Yep! We have seven magical girls, Miss Tomoe, just like the constellation!*" Michiru continues, picking up her thought from earlier. "*They're all wonderful people, and I'm very lucky to know them.*"

You can *hear* the bright, cheerful smile accompanying the statement, for all that it sends your mind into overdrive. Four people. Asami Saki, Wakaba Mirai, Kanna Niko, Usagi Satomi, in addition to Kazusa Michiru herself, Misaki Umika, and Maki Kaoru. All present and accounted for, though is Nikon being on the team means that Hijiri Kanna is around, too.

Mami wilts, expression shattering. Of course, Michiru having a team is indirectly Mami's fault. And talking about a team wasn't ever going to be not a touchy subject, with how lonely Mami was, but... more magical girls that are *her* doing, more magical girls consigned to having their Souls ripped out to fight an endless war for their survivals.

Fuck that.

"*That's an impressive group, Miss Kazusa.*" You pick up the slack, slowly stroking Mami's back in soothing circles. Her grip on your hand is almost crushing, knuckles bone white around yours. "*How's hunting?*"

"*Eh? Oh, Miss Sabrina!*" Michiru says, sounding bright and curious. If she's puzzled by you having effectively taken over the conversation, it doesn't show in her voice. "*Ah, yes, are you Mami's new student?*"

"*I'm Mami's student, Mami's friend...*" you say. But that's not enough, is it? It doesn't encapsulate your relationship. You blush. "*Uh... Well. I'm Mami's.*"

"*Ooh, like me and Umika and Kaoru,*" Michiru says. "*I see! I'm glad.*"

"*Yeah,*" you say, smiling at Mami's startled look. "*I'm actually pretty new as a magical girl, even though I know a lot about the magical girl world.*"

Kirika flashes you a discreet thumbs up, which you ignore.

"*Lucky!*" Kazusa says. "*And you have Miss Tomoe teaching you to help with the bits you don't know, too!*"

"*Yeah,*" you agree. "*I really *am* pretty lucky.*" More than Kazusa knows, but there's no need to cram your spiel down her throat just yet.

And hey, it wasn't all luck, either.

"*Hey, if you're Mami's student, and so am I, then you can call me sempai!*" Kazusa says cheerfully.

"*I- I have a team too, now,*" Mami says, her hand clamping down on yours, just a little more. You smile at her, gently brushing hair out of her face.

"*Oh, that's great!*" Kazusa says. "*Oh, was that them listening in earlier? And Miss Sabrina?*"

You smile encouragingly at Mami. She swallows hard, jaws working, before she shakes her head. You squeeze her hand back, gentle, but firm.

"*Yeah, I'm part of the team,*" you say, nodding. "*We only have four members proper, though.*"

"*Oh, that sounds great!*" Michiru says. "*Four of you with the whole city to yourselves?*"

That would be your cue to jump in, but... You eye Mami. She looks conflicted, a mix of simple elation and guilt and crushing regret. You exhale, and you release her hand so that you can hug her properly. It only takes a tiny effort to cleanse her Soul Gem, too, twists of Grief rippling free.

"*Hello? Miss Tomoe? Are you OK?*" Michiru says, sounding a little concerned.

Mami takes a deep, shuddering breath, looking up at you again. "*I'm fine,*" she says. "*J-just- it's been a while, Miss Kazusa.*"

"*It has,*" Michiru says, voice softening. "*It really would be nice to see you again, Miss Tomoe.*"

"*Um... Sabrina?*" Mami asks.

You squeeze her hand, watching as Oriko murmurs something to Kirika. The black haired girl bounces to her feet and off to the kitchen, irrepressibly energetic. Homura's eyes follow her. "*Yeah, we're actually planning a trip sometime, if that works for you?*"

"\*Oh, that would be \*wonderful," Michiru says. "*I now know how hard it is to leave your city behind, though! Maybe I could come over instead? I'll bring Umika and Kaoru with me!*"

You blink. That could actually solve a fair number of problems - like sidestepping Oriko's rather *dire* warnings. And with Michiru explicitly bringing Umika on a friendly visit, that would mean presumably that you don't need to test your possible resistance against mind control or anything.

Are there downsides? Maybe if there's something specific to Asunaro city that you need, like the anti-Kyuubey barrier or Jyuubey. But without Michiru Witching out, and hopefully she won't, they wouldn't exist yet, maybe. And Oriko and Kirika wouldn't get to go out.

Mami gives you a look you can best describe as conflicted - longing and terror at the same time.

"*Oh, can Mitakihara support another three magical girls, though?*" Michiru continues, blithely ignorant of your churning thoughts.

... On the other hand, she's practically handing you the perfect opening.

You smile at Mami, still stroking her back slowly, and you nod a little. If it's at all possible. "*Actually, Miss Kazusa, if I may divert the topic a little to answer your question?*"

"*Sure?*" Michiru says.

"*I control Grief,*" you say. "*I can cleanse Soul Gems.*"

"*Really? That's amazing!*" Michiru says, voice *brimming* with excitement.

"*She is,*" Mami murmurs. "*W-would you like to come and visit?*"

"*Or would it be easier for us to go over and visit you?*" you offer. "*I can actually move a few people *very* fast. I think I might be supersonic, but I'm not sure.*"

Angel of Grief, that's you. Heh. Then again, Sayaka probably makes the better angel. Mikiel or some such, perhaps.

"*Wow,*" Michiru breathes, sounding awed. "*Um, I'm not sure? It sounds like it would be easier for you to come over, but I'd love to see Mitakihara...*"

"*Mami?*" you prompt gently, smiling at her. Kirika returns from the kitchen with a plate of cookies, plonking it down on the middle of the coffee table before collecting a handful which she proceeds to stuff her face with, offering some to Oriko.

"*Maybe... maybe you could come over first? And then we travel to Asunaro after that?*" Mami suggests hesitantly, looking to you worriedly.

You smile at Mami and shift to hug her a little tighter, over Michiru's excited agreement. It would solve some issues. Not all, like *school*, but-

Speaking of school, you should ask.

"*Actually, before we plan more, I should ask - Miss Kazusa, do you go to school?*" you say, considering getting some of the cookies. But then, that would mean leaving Mami's side, and... not now. Besides, you have an odd craving for chips right now. "*Uh, well, *I* don't.*"

"*Oh, a delinquent!*" Michiru says. "*How exciting!*"

"*Sabrina is *not* a delinquent!*" Mami says sharply.

"*Eh? Oh no no no! I didn't mean it that way!*" Kazusa says, shaking her head. "*I mean- I'm a delinquent too. I don't go to school, being a magical girl takes up too much time!*"

Mami's shoulders sag a little.

For the record, Kazusa uses "Mami-san" to address Mami, and "Sabrina-san" for you. 'Translation' convention.

Also, I feel like I should point out that while the Pleiades cluster is known as the Seven Sisters, there are *nine* readily visible stars - the Seven Sisters and two parents. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

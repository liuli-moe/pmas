# Under the Radar pt. 24

You keeping holding Mami, stroking her back in slow, rhythmic circles. She curls into your side and ducks her head against you, hiding from the world in a tight, shivering huddle of misery pressed up against your side.

"*Yes,*" you say fervently, speaking into the golden mass of hair tucked under your chin. "Yes, of course I'll stay, Mami. I wouldn't leave you for the world."

Mami doesn't react, still clinging tightly to you.

You hold her, letting her reassure herself with your presence. The silence stretches out, broken by quiet, huffing breaths from Mami as she cuddles against you. Slowly, the shivering slows, and evens out.

"Mami?" you ask, voice quiet. "May I clean your Soul Gem?"

You feel her nod, her hair brushing against your skin. A flex of your will draws the Grief away from her Soul Gem, resting in ring form on her finger, to form a tenebrous cloud drifting aimlessly in the air. You crush it down into your usual marbles, packing them into you bag.

Tightly wound tension ebbs from Mami's body, and she sighs quietly as she sags against you. You continue to hold her, rubbing her back soothingly.

A while later, Mami stirs, turning her head so that she can speak. "I-I can't," Mami whispers so softly you can barely hear her. "I c-*can't* go back to b-being a-*alone*, S-Sabrina."

"And you *won't*, Mami," you say, maintaining your hug. "And... Mami, it's not just me. Madoka and Sayaka care about you too. Even Homura, in her own way." You smile into her hair, even if she can't see it. "I'm just the lucky girl who gets to live with you."

"N-" Mami shifts in your arms, looking up at you. "S-Sabrina, y-you're not *just*-"

You stroke her hair gently. "Mami, my point is that they're your friends, too. Just like me," you say, smiling at her.

Mami doesn't respond, simply returning to leaning her head against you.

You exhale slowly, returning to rubbing her back in slow, soothing circles. This... is really something that *needs* to take time to heal, you think. And *maybe* therapy, but then again, *Japan*. Your mind wanders a little, a thought you've been turning over for a while bobbing to the fore. Who *are* you? Apart from the obvious?

You... *think* you were created by Madoka's Wish, last loop. And you think Homura thinks so, too. You could technically call Madoka mom, in that case. Momdoka? Madomom? You can only imagine the expression on Homura's face if you said that in front of her. Or called *her* mom.

Mami shifts, turning in your arms to press closer into your side as your hand slows.

She needs, *deserves,* really, all the help you can get her. Maybe therapy, you muse, returning to that earlier thought. Track down a good therapist, and fill him in on magic, with a few object demonstrations of magic, a transformation or two. Perhaps get Kyuubey to agree to not wiping his mind.

Maybe.

Mami shifts again.

"Mami?" you ask, looking down at her.

She shakes her head. "N-nothing," Mami says, not looking up at you.

"Are you sure, Mami?" you ask gently. "I'm willing to listen if there's anything you want to say."

Mami hesitates for a long moment, shifting uncomfortably. She looks up at you, that fear still swimming in her golden eyes, before finally asking, "I-it's just. I. S-Sabrina, t-the s-secrets you k-know\..."

"Yes, Mami?" you say. "I can tell you... some of it, if you want to hear. I'm sorry, I. Some of it, I *can't* tell."

"N-n-" Mami shakes her head. "N-no. I j-just. How b-bad is it, S-Sabrina?"

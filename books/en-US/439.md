# Anomalous Materials pt. 4

"No, that's it," you say. You purse your lips, considering what it's told you - very little of substance, truth be told. What's probably definitive confirmation that Oriko's condition is caused by the rejection of her Wish

Probably.

"*Very well,*" Kyuubey agrees, eyes still fixed on yours and tail flicking in slow, metronomic motion. "*Goodbye!*"

The Incubator turns and slinks off to the edge of the roof, hopping right off.

You blink. That... was surprisingly painless - you were kind of expecting it to try and stick with you and badger you with more questions or something.

Of course, Kyuubey ostensibly leaving doesn't preclude it following you around, or surveying you from afar. You've... pretty much been running on the conclusion that that's *exactly* what it's been doing, in any case.

It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you! Or at least it's healthy paranoia, and against an alien empire with purportedly universe spanning reach, you can't be *too* paranoid.

That's what you tell yourself, anyway. Though whether Kyuubey's out to get you is something you debate hotly with yourself.

You huff, looking at the Grief you've left behind. You kept enough, really - a handful of large spheres of Grief. That will suffice for wings, or a Mobile Oppression Fortress or privacy bubble or something, though sadly not a MECHA GURREN ZILLA LAGAAN.

In any case, you have things to do. You can ruminate about Kyuubey later.

You look up, wings unfurling behind you. Great swathes of Grief cut through the morning sky, and a powerful stroke launches you skyward.

You close your eyes, exhaling as you spiral upwards into the cloudy sky.

You'll go on an impromptu patrol of sorts. That area with the car crash needs checking, in particular.

Hah. It's just serendipity, surely. You happened to hear it on the news - but it can't have been the only accident that happened in Mitakihara, just the only one that happened to be reported when you turned in. You mean, it *could* be a Witch, but not every accident is caused by a Witch and not every Witch causes accidents.

Hm. Downtown Mitakihara. They didn't give an address, but you *think* you know where it is, from that shot they showed.

You swoop past the skyscrapers, soaring above the glittering steel and glass towers. In the distance, you can see the early morning sun sparkling off Mitakihara river. The sound of pedestrains and vehicles drift up to you, muffled by the distance.

Downtown, downtown... You alight on a building, looking around. You're going to have to get down to the ground level, you reckon.

You do just that, leaping off the side of the building. A massive downstroke of your wings breaks your fall, stirring up a cloud of sand and trash. Detransforming, you wander out of the alley.

It's *loud* here. There's still people commuting, presumably to work - hundreds of soberly dressed office workers cramming the walkways from side to side. And it was... that way, you think. You let yourself move with the crowd, drifting in the direction you want to go.

You spot the bits of broken glass scattered about the floor first - they haven't cleaned it up yet. And then you notice the signs put up, with a tacked on date and information. "Appeal for witnesses: FATAL ACCIDENT: 07-07-11 SATURDAY 5:30PM. Please call..."

Yep. This is the place.

You drift over to a corner out of the flow of human traffic, beside a little ramen stand. You push your senses out, listening without your ears and seeing without your eyes.

It's an *odd* thing, your Grief sense.

You don't find any magical girls here, nor any Witches in the immediate area as you push your senses, inspecting everything within your range. Thoughtfully, you merge back into the crowds, walking a slow spiral around the site of the accident. As you walk, you take a moment to turn your senses to your side, inspecting Elsa Maria's Grief Seed.

It seems like a normal Grief Seed, as far as you can see. There's... nothing special about it.

You sigh, pulling your phone from your pocket to check the time as you turn down an alleyway. Barely past nine. You transform, and with a few quick bounds, you hop up to the roof of the office building.

A wave of your hand draws Grief around you, wispy torrents melting from your ever present cloud of Grief spheres and pouring into a thin shell around you. One particular sphere of Grief arrives by your side just as the shield seals itself fully. In absolute darkness, you exhale, eyes falling closed as you bear down with your will.

*Isolation*.

When you open your eyes again - it's to absolute darkness, and a sensation pressing on you. *Witch*. You purse your lips, and another touch of will adds a gentle glow to the inside of the sphere, emanating from all angles. It's a good thing you're not particularly bothered by the dark.

Roller coasters, though. Those *do* bother you a bit. Not terribly badly, considering that you can *fly*, but still.

You shake those thoughts free, and dip your fingers into the sphere of Grief hovering patiently at your side. The solid Grief parts like oil before your hand, and you withdraw Homura's notebook of Witches.

You read by Witch-light, paging through notes and descriptions written in Homura's delicate hand.

You find... hm. There's a reference here to a train-themed Witch, that's... the timescale's right, certainly, but the location is a few kilometers from here. Chewing on the lip, you stare at the description in the book for a long moment. Train Witch with huge cutting circular saws for wheels and teeth and stuff.

Hm.

You flip through the rest of the notebook, finding nothing really relevant. Homura had mentioned that she hadn't written in *every* Witch, just those she'd encountered more, but still.

You grumble to yourself, dissolving the... you'll call it an isolation field, because why not. The Grief pours away, wispy torrents imploding back into the usual spheres.

You walk over to the edge of the roof, looking down as you contemplate your next course of action. Hm. You could go after that Witch, maybe. Or you could go to Oriko's - you have a laundry list of things you want to consult her about, and you're not done with helping her, in any case.

"Hmmhmmm," you hum quietly to yourself.

"*Ah, sorry, Miss Bennouna,*" Mami's voice intrudes in your head. She stumbles a little on the name. "*This is my friend Sabrina. Sabrina, this is Miss Nadia Bennouna, she's a travelling magical girl.*"

"*'ello\~!*" A light alto responds in heavily accented but intelligible Japanese. "*Pleased to meet you.*"

"*Pleased to meet you, Miss Bennouna,*" you respond politely.

"*Sabrina, Miss Bennouna is a travelling magical girl who carries news between cities,*" Mami explains. "*She's come through Mitakihara a few times before.*"

"*N'aam, yes,*" the new magical girl says. "*There are interesting things 'appening, I thought best to go to Mitakihara early, fimti?*"

Mami doesn't say anything, clearly waiting to follow your lead.

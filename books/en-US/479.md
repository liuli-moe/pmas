# Anomalous Materials pt. 44

Your frown can only deepen. You give some consideration to giving Madoka a hug, but really, you don't need to hammer on that now. Madoka doesn't even seem to take it as anything more than a joke, anyway.

"That's..." you shake your head. "That's really weird."

"You don't say," Sayaka grumbles. "I was looking forward to trying out your powers, too."

You worry at your lower lip for a bit, your mind churning with hypotheses and explanations. You...

For once, you're actually pretty sure what the problem is. You've only really got two plausible candidates, and they aren't even mutually exclusive explanations. *Fixing* the problem, insofar as there's anything to fix, is another matter, but you're reasonably sure you know what went wrong.

Refreshing, if anticlimactic.

"Kyuubey *did* say that there was something strange about my potential when I contracted," you say slowly, sliding your arm around Mami's waist to pull her into a hug. "Right? Sayaka, Madoka?"

Sayaka blinks and snaps her fingers. "Yeah! I remember that," she says. "He actually sounded confused."

Madoka nods emphatically. "Do you think that could be it, Sabrina?"

"Yeah, it makes sense," Sayaka nods, looking thoughtful. "Like, magic comes from our potentials, right?"

"It does," Mami agrees.

"There *are* magical girls from outside Japan, right?" Hitomi asks. "That... might be a silly question, but I would like to be clear?"

"Of course there are," Mami answers, nodding. "I know a few."

Sayaka claps. "Oh! Maybe we'll get to meet them sometime!"

"In point of fact," Mami says. "One will be travelling to Mitakihara... was it the day after, Sabrina?"

"Sunday," you confirm. "Nadia Bennouna -her surname's Bennouna, by the way- is travelling here, but Mami knows more than I do."

"Ah, not that much," Mami demurs with a little smile. "She's a travelling magical girl, she travels to cities around the world to carry news."

Hitomi tilts her head. "Don't you have..." she taps the side of her head.

"Yes, but you can't communicate with people you haven't met in person before," Mami explains. "Think of her more as a travelling newspaper salesman than a mail service, though I do believe she does that too."

"Mmm," Hitomi says, nodding thoughtfully. "That makes sense."

"Yeah!" Sayaka agrees. "We're all going to meet her, right?"

Mami shrugs. "I don't see why not. Why did you ask about foreign magical girls, Hitomi?"

"Just... making sure," the greenette says, seeming a bit embarrassed. "Sabrina isn't from Japan, so I wanted to check whether that could be it."

You chuckle. "No, that's not it. At least I hope not," you say. "Also, um, on the subject - the other hypothesis I have is that I specifically *Wished* for this power, and that changes things? Though I feel like we need a bigger sample size to work with to confirm this, either way."

Mami nods thoughtfully. "Do you think Homura would volunteer?"

"Maybe," you say. "Though I suspect she might also be a... special case? What I'd like to do is contacting some of the magical girls I've met and seeing if she can try on them. Like maybe going with us to Sendai this Sunday?"

"That's a good idea," Mami agrees with a nod.

You sigh, rolling your shoulders. "Anyway. Since that's out for now\... what's next, Mami?"

Mami tugs thoughtfully on one of her hair-drills. "I was going to guide Sayaka through exploring her power for about half an hour before we went to try hunting a Witch," she says. "As it is... Sayaka, I feel that you're ready to go on a Witch hunt with us - Sabrina and I can catch any mistakes you might make, and I'd like to see how you fare against a real Witch. Sabrina, what do you think?"

"I'm up for that," you say with a nod. "I don't think Madoka and Hitomi should come with us for that, though." You give them an apologetic look. "We'll need to watch Sayaka's performance, and it'd be dangerous."

"Hey, Madoka and I got to go with Mami!" Sayaka protests.

"No, Sabrina's right," Mami says. "It's easier to protect people who are trying to stay back than to watch for someone who's in the middle of things. And... this *is* your first hunt, Sayaka. Maybe next time?"

Sayaka deflates.

Madoka, on the other hand, smiles, wide and guileless. "I understand," she says.

"As do I," Hitomi says, nodding. "I shall head to the hospital, then, to visit Kyousuke."

"Ah!" Sayaka says. "I'll be headed there after the hunt, too! Uh-" Her eyes dart over to you and Mami. "If there's nothing after the hunt?"

You shrug, deferring to Mami, who shakes her head. "No," she says. "There shouldn't be anything else."

"Ah... then I'll go to the hospital too," Madoka offers. "We can all meet up afterwards? And, um, Sayaka, we have that assignment from Miss Saotome to do..."

"Sounds good to me," Sayaka says. "And that assignment isn't due for a week!"

Mami rubs her gloved hands together. "Why don't we walk you to the hospital, and then start our hunt from there?" she suggests.

Madoka brightens. "That sounds great!"

"Yeah," Sayaka agrees. "C'mon, let's go!" She drops her arms around Madoka and Hitomi's shoulders and starts towing them out of the junkyard.

"Don't forget to detransform!" you call, shaking your head as you do just that. You slant a lazy grin towards Mami as she, too, detransforms. "That girl."

Mami giggles. "She's eager."

"Mmmhm," you agree, sparing an effort of will to dissolve the Grief chairs and sort away all the Grief into your usual drifting planetarium of spheres.

Bumping your shoulder against Mami's, you meander after the trio. It's... comfortable. You've really lucked out with your friendships, in many ways. You put in a good deal of effort, but there was a decent helping of good luck, too. Some part of you is paranoid, but hey, it's not like you're going to betray yourself or something, right?

Then again, what if you pranked yourself. That's... something that might happen. Like putting rocks in your shoes before you go to sleep, to give yourself a 'damn you past me' moment in the morning if you forget. You *could* say you're training yourself to have a better memory.

Eh, that's kind of silly.

Eventually, you all reach the hospital and bid farewell to Madoka and Hitomi for now. Sayaka turns to you, beaming. "What now?"

"Rooftops?" you ask Mami.

"Mmmhm!" she agrees, leading the way down an alley. "Sayaka, follow our lead, OK? You should be able to do this." You transform, and follow Mami in wall-hopping up to the roof of the apartment block.

Mami peeks her head over the side. "Come on up, Sayaka! You can do this!"

Sayaka follows with only a moment of hesitation. Cracks of shattering concrete drift up to you, followed by a muffled yelp of surprise.

Mami grins at you, raising an eyebrow.

"Hey, I don't do that anymore," you say as Sayaka crests the roof. She stumbles and slumps into a seated position, cape draping over her shoulders. "Thanks to the tip you gave me!"

"What tip," Sayaka grumbles. "You just left me behind!"

"It's not something we can really teach," you offer. "You have to learn by doing. Or more like find the instincts within yourself."

"I suppose we could have carried you up," Mami offers with an amused smile. "Ribbons, or Sabrina's powers."

"No thanks," Sayaka complains. She pushes herself to her feet, energy returning. "Anyway, where to now?"

"Hmm..." Mami says, considering the skyline. "We should do the hospital route, since we're here."

"Works for me," you agree. "Take the lead, Mami!"

She beams at you, brilliant and warm, and does just that.

Sayaka proves a quick study in roofhopping, bounding lightly from building to building. She soars, cape fluttering lightly -*heroically*- after her as she leaps, dashing and *bold* in contrast to Mami's elegance and your own pragmatic and vaguely parkour-like style.

*Crack*.

... not so much the not-breaking-rooftops part, though.

It doesn't take you long to find a Witch, your Grief senses letting you home in on it. You find yourself crouching atop what seems to be a theater, modern but as yet unopened. The Barrier hangs in the air, drifting slowly away.

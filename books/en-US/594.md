# Highway 17 pt. 18.5

"Hijiri, *help me*," you say urgently. And at the same time, you pull your magic back, retracting from Mami's ribbons. "Don't. We don't have to fight. Nobody has to lose."

Mami slumps for the barest heartbeat against you, and then stiffens.

You hold Hijiri's gaze, the blazing crackle of magic inside her curling into wire-taut tension. It's activity you don't recognise, but she's preparing to use magic.

"Hijiri, please," you say. "You *can* have your peaceful life. But as much as I want to, I can't give it to you, or to Anri or to the Pleiades."

At the same time, your mind snaps out by telepathy. "*Oriko, Kirika, get here*now," you bark.

"You can't give me what I want," Hijiri says with a bitter smile - and dissolves into a blinding streak of lightning.

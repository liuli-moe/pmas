# Hazard Course Pt. 17

Steam explodes all around you, backlit in ruby red and white. You juke as fire hisses through the rain in raging torrents *heavy* with magic and this can't possibly be sustainable for one, or even *two* magical girls but it's not even *hard* to guess how let alone *see* it, Grief blazing in two, three, *four* Soul Gems-

-and then five, as the Soujus' delight rings out in peals of ringing laughter.

You've got to end this quick.

Time almost seems to slow as your mind races through plans. You can't snatch their Soul Gems - not when the Soujus, of all people, likely know how to act *as* Soul Gems. You've got to keep your distance, too. With their powers, you're not convinced they can't knock *you* out somehow. But with your wings, with you rising above the asphalt of the multi-storey parking lot, you don't think that's too much of an issue as long as you *dodge*.

Another beam of fire blazes towards you, crimson flame twined about an icy core crawling through the air with distant speed as you think.

Then again, you've already made up your mind.

The boom of Mami's muskets forms a familiar percussion, golden shots slashing through the rain to hem the Soujus in. Sayaka fades into invisibility once more, there and gone again in arcs of flashing steel that never connect. The Soujus dance and laugh, breathlessly giddy amidst the falling rain and burning burning magic into speed and *flame* that blasts rain into expanding clouds and shrouding the battlefield. They dodge, and weave, flickering frostfire blazing in uncaring defiance.

That's hindrance to neither you nor Mami. Nor to Kyouko, you think, racing up the side of the building with Yuma at her side - but they're going to be late to the party.

Action follows thought. The air crystallizes in that moment between heartbeats, Grief unfolding from hammerspace and dripping from your wings to darken the sky in a thousand, thousand, *thousand* malevolent shards. You close the dome around them in that glacial moment between heartbeats.

Sound takes *time* to propagate, so you can only imagine the air screaming as each fragment of midnight slices inwards.

Enough blades to blot out the struggling sun. Enough blades to rival the raindrops in the sky. Enough blades to block off *every* angle of escape, stygian knives cutting through the gloom in a closing dome around the Soujus. Even beneath their feet, Grief flooding through the concrete infiltrating through a million infinitesimal cracks and the spaces between molecules just in case they decide to dodge downwards.

Every single one of the Soul Gems on them glows bright in your mind's eye. Two, three, seven, nine. Nine, all told. Two their own and seven stolen. Seven too many, and yet, you feel like that's fewer than there should be. But that's a thought for later, when you talk.

They're just beginning to react, to turn towards you with wide, fever-bright delight. Lightning fast, perhaps, with whatever superspeed they're tapping into. But slower than thought, slower than Grief.

The maw of Grief slams shut around them.

Their own magic is a little faster. Their body ignites, blazing crimson and arctic chill wreathing their form in an incandescent halo as they duck on instinct. It works, too, dense flame smashing aside some of your blades.

The *distraction* slams shut around them.

Because you control *Grief*.

You tear the Grief from their Soul Gems.

They're fast. Fast enough to twist into a useless dodge. Fast enough to blast away some of the Grief suddenly *right next to them-*

*-but not fast enough*.

Blades meet flesh.

Flesh, then bone.

Arms, torso, leg... neck. A burst of fire deflects some blades and saves one of their legs.

And...

Déjà vu.

Widened eyes in the corner of your vision, Sayaka fading back into visibility with bloodless face and horrified stare. Kyouko and Yuma are just about to reach the roof, sprinting up the side of the building in bursts of magic. Mami's attention snapping up to you to check on you.

The Soujus sliding apart into a bloodless heap.

Bloodless, because Grief leashed to your will is weapon and tool both, every cut sealed as it's made and oxygenated because it's not like you're going to *not* heal them afterwards, and because that would simply be *cruel*, because you're going to want to *talk* to them later too, but-

*Déjà vu*.

They're not down, and now that you're looking at it, their Soul Gems, two of them, are blazing ever brighter in your mind's eye.

And maybe something about your expression draws Mami's attention to them too as her eyes snap to the Souju's body.

Both of you lash out together, guided by some sixth sense. Mami's ribbons unspool like striking snakes, reaching for one Gem -red, Souju Luca- and so you snatch for the other with Grief-

"*Apart!*" you bark at Mami, words tumbling over each other as fast as you can think. "*They're stronger together!*"

-and you yank. There's a *resistance* to it, their magic binding them together. Not *nearly* enough, their Soul Gems flying apart. One to you, one to Mami.

Just in time, as their magic builds to a crescendo. Fire blazes around the one you have bound in Grief, purest crimson erupting all around it with the concussive force, a hammerstrike of pure power turned against yours. A contest of will and magic, Souju Ayase's rapturous delight and terror and awe hurled against yours in a single last-ditch attack, her soul an incandescent nova of power.

You crush her magic with a thought, and wrap her Soul Gem securely in Grief.

She's not unconscious. You can still sense her magic flickering within her Soul Gem, but you don't sense her building towards another attack, either, and that's enough for now as you turn your attention to Mami and the other Souju.

Mami seems to be having more trouble with Luca, her forehead beading with sweat as her own magic flares bright in your mind's eye, a constant, ever-shifting weave of gold. Ribbons web from hand to hand, twisting with her movements as she juggles the frost-laden Soul Gem, her eyes intent and utterly focused.

You don't dare intervene, not when one wrong move could send Mami off-balance - but you keep your Grief at the ready, a dense cloud hovering nearby to aid her if you need to. And your faith in her is proven a moment later, Mami snapping her hand to the side in a sharp, decisive moment as ribbons bind tight around Luca's Soul Gem, a golden lock flashing into existence.

"H-holy s-" Sayaka staggers, propping herself up with her sword, and then crumpling to her knees as she retches. Kyouko's there a moment later, offering her support as Sayaka empties her stomach on the rooftop. Yuma hovers nearby, darting horror-struck looks from the Souju's body to their Soul Gems.

"Jesus fuckin' Christ," Kyouko mutters, supporting Sayaka with one hand and pulling Yuma into her side with the other. "Cleanse yourself, Wondergirl."

You feel a telepathic contact in your mind from Mami, accepting it a moment later as she speaks.

"*Homura,*" she says. "*Is Sayaka alright?*"

"*Madoka is escorting her to the nurse's office,*" Homura responds immediately. "*Are you well?*"

"*We are,*" Mami says. She shoots you a swift smile as you land on the roof, her eyes scanning you for injury. "*We won the fight, and none of us were hurt, but it was, ah, a touch messy.*"

You return the smile as you dismiss your wings, checking her over in turn - neither of you actually took hits, but you can't help but worry.

"*Understood,*" Homura says. You can hear the frown in her mental voice, a touch of concern bleeding through. "*Sayaka has her Clear Seed. Will she be alright?*"

"*She will,*" you say as you hurry over to the Souju's body. "*She damn well will. She's strong. And if she needs a bit of help, we'll be there to provide it.*"

You can sense their stolen Soul Gems still, all of them now quiet. You've been keeping them all cleansed, after all, even the Souju's. And... you feel a twinge of guilt as you stare down at what you did to them, but they're magical girls. A person torn apart, sheared into a dozen pieces, and bloodless for all that, each cut sealed in with a flat plane of midnight Grief, each part still *alive* and lying there in the puddling rain. Almost shocking in the lack of gore for the damage you did, since you caught it all.

Not the first time you've witnessed this sort of harm, but the first time you've personally inflicted even *remotely* this sort of harm on a person. And even so...

They're *alive*, and you're going to do your level best to sort this out.

And maybe you should contemplate your own lack of reaction, especially when...

Well.

More pertinent is the worry for Sayaka, now dry-heaving - her first *real* encounter with violence and this sort of bodily *trauma*, you think. Adrenaline and horror make for a potent mixture, and you'll check on her in a moment, and maybe do some self-reflection, but first, the Souju's captives.

"*Wait! P-please!*" As you reach for the Soul Gems, a new telepathic voice intrudes on your mind - but one you recognise. This is... one of the Soujus, the timbre her mental voice somehow *lesser* than when you'd heard it moments ago raised in fever-bright laughter. "*Please, not o-our friends!*"

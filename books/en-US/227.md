# "We've Got Hostiles" pt. 16

"*Right,*" you murmur back to Mami. "*The ones who went to meet you, right?*"

"*Yes,*" Mami answers, still standing placidly at your side as you bring your carpet to the edge of the roof. The three of you remain standing on the carpet, a line of three facing down a loose group of four.

You compress the slowly turning hurricane down into the basketball sized spheres, which set themselves in orbit around you, a lazily spinning series of planets orbiting around the three of you on your carpet. The *presence* in your puella magi senses dims noticeably, diminishing to barely-there levels, and the dappled purple sunlight shifts to a more normal shade of evening orange.

The girls down on the roof relax fractionally, weapons and wary stances lowering a bare centimeter.

"*Kirika, Mami,*" you say telepathically. "*If Sendai teleports in, and I think they might, antimagic and ribbons immediately, OK?*"

"*OK,*" Mami agrees easily.

"*Gotcha,*" Kirika's voice sounds cheerily in your head.

"Hello," you call out loud, pitching your voice to carry.

One girl takes a single step forward. She has enormous, butterfly-like wings sprouting from her back, cheerful, pastel colours splashed across black ribbing. "Hello," she calls back cautiously. "Are you the Mitakihara girls?"

"Yes," you say. "I'm Sabrina, just Sabrina, this is Tomoe Mami, and Kure Kirika."

Mami dips her head in a regal little nod, gaze steady on the speaker. You notice that another girl - one with a long, flowing mane of deep purple hair, is also looking at Mami with a surprised look. Umeko Yuko, you'll assume.

The speaking girl nods, swallowing. "I am Tsubaki Chouko, and these are my friends, Suzuki Rei-" The girl with pale green hair lifts her hand in a cautious little wave, her other hand still around her sword. A few scraps of white paper drifting around her and the oddly angular cut of her cream coloured dress attest to her power.

"-Suzuki Haru-" Bone white hair, a shade and cut not unlike your own shoulder length hair, shifts in a nod. The plant controller, if the way her hand is sunk into a nearby vine is any indication.

"-and Umeko Yuko," Chouko finishes, pointing at the last girl of their party, the one who'd recognized Mami. She also nods cautiously at you.

"I-" Yuko licks her lips, looking at Mami. "It's... a surprise to see you here, Miss Tomoe."

A smile flickers across Mami's face, and she glances aside at you. "I have reason to be here," she says.

Yuko nods slowly, fiddling with her mane of deep purple hair. "Can I- can *we* ask why?" Her eyes flick to Chouko.

Mami smiles again, and gestures at you. "I think that's Sabrina's job."

You nod. "Uh, first things first... there are five Soul Gems, but four of you."

Chouko's expression closes off, her lips thinning into a line. "Yes."

"Do one of them belong to the Sendai group?" you query.

"Yes," Chouko admits, a flicker of worry crossing her face as she wraps her arms around herself.

"I'm trying to broker peace, and put an *end* to this war, if you've heard from Miss Inoue, out of Ishinomaki," you say, folding your arms. "Where's the body?"

"I heard, yes," she admits. "Um. Yuko?"

"Somewhere over there?" the purple haired girl says, waving off to her left.

"Right," you nod, and reach out with your telepathy - Rin and Akiko. You note idly that they've retreated out of your range, by now. "*Akiko, Rin. We might need you for a patch job on someone here.*"

"*What?*" Akiko bites off the word. "*We don't hav-* they have Rin!"

Wait, *what*?

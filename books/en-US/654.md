# Point Insertion pt. 23

And *that's* the problem. You try to see the best in everyone.

Everything can be fixed.

But Rionna is making it so very hard to *not* consider her an enemy to all you hold dear. You *try* not to grind your teeth as your mind explodes - part of you still wants to strike first. Strike hard, and you can take her out with ease. For all her bravado, she is cut off from her powers and at the center of *yours*.

But. But, but, *but*-

You're not a murderer. You don't want to be. Mami wouldn't want you to be, Madokami -Mado*ka*- wouldn't want you to be.

*Homura* wouldn't want you to be, you think.

Homura has killed. She's killed people on *presumptions*, but-

She wouldn't kill if she didn't feel she had to.

And the difference, the *difference*, still remains that Rionna's so very cavalier about these things. Utterly callous, throwing them in your face, and-

Wait.

*Wait*.

The question remains -the question you never really asked in all that anger- is *why*. Why would she be doing this? She's blunt and irascible, *but-*

There's two questions here, aren't there?

You feel pressure on your Grief, from outside. Mami, bringing a hand to touch the Grief you have draped around your shoulder, and you squeeze lightly, reassuringly. She relaxes.

Why would Rionna do what she *does*? She's maintaining an entire city, and apparently keeping it on such tight rein she's reluctant to leave for too long. Perhaps it's simply a matter of course, and of confidence, that she believes no fight would take her longer than that.

And you can feel the Grief trickling up. Hers is certainly a power that requires upkeep, and it's filling at a rate that's unsustainable.

Either she's using her Grief controllers to keep herself clean, or... perhaps her power requires a higher upkeep because she's so far away. Or perhaps she's maintaining a combat ready state right now. Perhaps. The latter doesn't feel *right*, though, with the *disdain* she shows Grief controllers.

Of course, it could all be an *act*, but down that way lies endless spirals of paranoia.

But.

The other *why* to ask is why she's so abrasive, right now.

And...

She could be trying to goad you into attacking her. Perhaps she has some trump card, and perhaps she wants you to give her an *excuse*. Perhaps.

This was a wasted trip for her, or so it seems. She *wanted* something from you. She was abrasive from the get-go, but... She holds an entire city. Apparently it's *religiously* cleared of other magical girls.

*Why*? She's lived a long time in an existence that kills young. *Something* drives her, something greater than mere survival. She's harsh and antisocial and apparently driven to hunt down Grief controllers while maintaining an absolute iron grip over her city.

She holds *Edinburgh*, and she clings to it with every shade she has.

Why?

And there's Oriko's warning about Rionna's sister.

You're not happy with what she's done. You're *not* convinced she's not a monster. You're not convinced...

You're not convinced she's *unforgivable*.

"I can't tell you how to act," you say, and meet her eyes squarely. "But whatever it is you're dealing with back home in Edinburgh, I can help you with it."

Rionna blinks, something flickering across her face. *That's a hit*, and that's more information than you had before. Something new you didn't know before.

"My magic can do far more than just move Grief around," you say, gesturing at the privacy field around you. "And what I *can't* do, I've got people for - or I can find people for. Unlimited cleansing is kind of the ultimate bargaining chip."

She looks away, and coughs roughly into the back of her hand.

Madoka would try.

And if you're wrong, if she's hostile, well.

Your magic can do *far* more than just move Grief around. What *you* can't do, you have your friends for.

"You can't help me," Rionna says, shaking her head. "Go back to your girl, go back to your friends. Y' don't want this fight, neither do I."

# Highway 17 pt. 9

"Like hell you get to attack us and just *go*!" Saki snaps, fists clenched.

"Hey," you say, stepping forward - *between* Saki and Hijiri. Of course, you're mindful of the probable boundary of the memory field. "Calm down, both of you. We'll get to the bottom of this."

You reach out by telepathy, at the same time. Mami, Sayaka, and Saki, Kazumi and Niko and all the rest of the Pleiades. "*Right. Kazumi, everyone, Saki's keeping you updated, right?*"

"*Hijiri claims someone *else* is pulling the strings,*" Niko says, voice practically dripping frost.

You glance from Saki to Hijiri, making sure that Saki isn't about to do anything precipitous. "OK. Miss Hijiri, I'm sorry, but we can't let you go until this is solved. I'm sorry for that. And I'm sorry we scared you."

Hijiri slumps in the bonds, head hanging low.

You toy with the idea of revealing your own possibly Wish-born status. It might help build a rapport; the Hijiri you *remember* was sympathetic to Kazumi-the-clone's status as an artificial human. Perhaps. But perhaps not useful now.

"*Yeah,*" you say to Niko. "*I'm sorry, Niko. But... what do you think. Plausible? Do you think we should still be searching for Anri, just in case?*"

At the same time, you nod at Hijiri. "Look. We're not after *you*, specifically, we're after whomever attacked our friends."

"*I... I might lie to cover my tracks,*" Niko admits. "*Under similar circumstances. But... the best lies have a kernel of truth.*"

"*Damn,*" Kazumi hisses. "*Miss Oriko, Miss Kirika, are you still there?*"

"*Yes,*" Oriko responds. "*We'll continue searching, but we cannot cover ground as quickly.*"

"*Us too,*" Umika says. "*We'll keep searching, right, Satomi?*"

"*Ask her if she knows where Anri went,*" Kazumi says sharply. "*Might be worth a try.*"

"Where did she go?" Saki snaps, focusing on Hijiri.

"Yuuri? She- she went south-east," Hijiri says. "I think- I'm not sure she stayed in the city. She said something about laying low."

"*South-east,*" Saki conveys. "*Umika, Satomi, keep an eye out. Miss Oriko, Miss Kirika, you too.*"

You close your eyes, exhaling slowly for a moment as both pairs echo acknowledgement. Mami's hand is warm in yours, something which you can center yourself on. You're not sure whether Hijiri's lying or not. Some things don't really add up, and you're not sure if you should be reading into her odd expressions when you could explain it as just... duress. She's not the greatest liar, if she *is* lying, but can you take that risk?

Alright. Here's something you *can* do.

"Miss Hijiri," you say slowly as a thought occurs to you. "Can you put me through to Miss Yuuri, by telepathy? Since you've been contacted by her before."

Hijiri hesitates, her free arm plucking uncomfortably at a shred of paper hanging free from the layer of paper keeping her bound. You can't blame her, not with the bindings suspending her midair like some bug entrapped by a spider, which is perhaps entirely too appropriate a metaphor for *anyone* to be comfortable with.

"I can't," she admits. "I think - I think this memory field cuts me off from telepathy."

"That's *convenient* for you, isn't it," Sayaka mutters, half under her breath as she gives Hijiri a disgusted glare.

Saki seems to share the sentiment, if not the restraint. "Yeah, right," she scoffs derisively. "Isn't it *perfect* that we can't verify your claims?"

"It... sounds plausible," you say, biting back an aggrieved sigh. "I mean, if she's undetectable while inside the field..."

"*Miss Niko, does your memory enchantment prevent telepathy from working?*" Mami asks, squeezing your hand gently. You give her a quick smile for jumping on the obvious solution.

"*It... would,*" Niko acknowledges after a moment. "*If it were targeting a person.*"

"*Right,*" you say. "*Then how do we disable the memory field?*"

"*You... don't,*" Niko says. "*It's a prototype. It'll burn out in a day if you don't recharge it, or if you smash it.*"

"*Right,*" you say, suppressing a scowl. Which means you need to convince Hijiri to give it up, or pluck it from the grasp of a scared girl - or approach a possibly still dangerous adversary.

"*I'll be there soon,*" Niko says. "*I see you.*"

You turn, glancing back.

"There," Mami murmurs, nudging you and pointing upwards to a soaring speck, barely visible against the lightening sky. You recognise the teal-coloured wings - that *would* be Niko, then.

You return your attention to Hijiri. Her eyes are fixed to that growing speck, face gone pale. Sayaka's watching her warily, fingers flexing slowly tap-tap-tap on her thigh. She's wary, and suspicious.

Cloth booms as Niko approaches, the wings of her hang glider rippling in the wind. She lands on the roof, boots scraping over concrete as her hang-glider collapses back into her backpack, and stares at Hijiri. There's no trace of her dreamy contemplation here, just sharp, stark anger.

Her clone stares right back, face chalk-white. Side by side, face to face, you doubt you'd be able to tell them apart - they look *exactly* the same as each other. Well, apart from the terror on Hijiri's face.

*That* much isn't faked, you don't think.

You stretch your senses out, and you check her Witch name, just to be sure.

*Hecate*.

That's her, then, but...

"Where's Mirai?" you ask with a frown.

"She said she'd meet up with Kazumi and Kaoru," Niko snaps brusquely, and gestures at Hijiri. "Get those off her!"

You glance at Mami, who nods minutely at you, and you nod in turn at Sayaka. You'll all be on guard. The blue haired girl scowls, but raises her free hand and pulls at thin air.

The paper rips itself to shreds, and you ease your Grief back. You let it dissolve back into your utility fog, particles dwindling away to let the remains of Sayaka's paper cocoon flutter to the roof.

Niko marches straight forward, and before you can shout a warning, slaps Hijiri across the face. The smack rings out across the roof, the *force* of the blow sending Hijiri spinning to the ground.

"You *idiot*," Niko snarls. "You were supposed to live happy and not... *this*!"

"What was I supposed to do?" Hijiri snarls right back. She doesn't stand, balanced in a crouch with one hand on the roof and one touching her reddened cheek. "What was I supposed to do when I found out I was just some- some *fake*? Am I just your *doll* to live through?"

"No!" Niko snaps. "You were supposed to *live* like I never could!"

Saki taps you on the shoulder, gesturing backwards and away from the confrontation. She points upwards at another growing speck in the sky, this one much harder to make out with its sky-coloured camouflage. Kazumi incoming, then.

"Yeah, *right*!" Hijiri spits back. "You just- you just wanted to throw away your guilt! Pretend you could be *happy!*"

You shake your head, rather than try and make yourself heard over the shouting match, and you jerk your head back towards them. You need to watch Hijiri.

"*You* could have been happy!" Niko snarls.

Saki grits her teeth, grabbing you by the shoulder and trying to drag you away. "*Niko can handle herself,*" she snaps.

# A Red Letter Day pt. 22

"We should probably eat before heading home today," Mami murmurs, curled up comfortably at your side. You have one arm around her, pulling her snugly against your side.

"Mmm," you agree. "We'll probably spend... half an hour talking to the Mikunis?"

"It's nice to eat out now and then," Mami offers, smiling at you. She shifts a little in your embrace, drawing your arm more firmly around her. "I know a place?"

"Absolutely," you say, smiling back. You pause, and glance at the bulging plastic bags at the back of your flying disc. "Hm. Would we need to drop off our part of the groceries before we went for dinner? Nothing frozen, but..."

Mami considers this. "No, even the udon should keep just fine," she says. "We can just leave it out with the rest of your... Grief while we eat?"

"Works for me," you say, nodding. You tilt the flying platform forward, already starting to descend towards the little hill the Mikuni residence is built on. It's... the building is in pretty decent shape, barring the remnants of the vandalism from the whole Mikuni Hisaomi scandal.

You have vague notions of helping them to clean it up, but you're in a rather *odd* position with regards to the Mikunis. You'd like to be their friends, and you're pretty sure you *are* Kirika's friend, but there's the fact that you're *technically* their jailer, if very loosely and tenuously so. Makes things a little awkward, to say the least.

Ah, well.

"What do you think about Kuroki?" Mami asks, reaching up to poke your earlobe.

"Heh, I was gonna ask you that," you say, slightly distracted by Mami's finger curiously exploring the shell of your ear. "I think... I don't know. Is it possible she was... right there or something? Hidden by her powers?"

"I wouldn't think so," Mami says. "Her trail was quite old, wasn't it? I suppose it's not out of the question for her powers to be able to disguise that."

You scowl thoughtfully to yourself, resolving to complain to Homura about not being specific about Kuroki's powers. It's the second time she did that, even. Of course, given what must be an ingrained habit over dozens of loops of enforced secrecy, you can't exactly expect her to ease up instantly, you guess. "Is it?"

"Not entirely?" Mami says, but she sounds doubtful. "Magic can be enormously varied."

"Fair enough," you say. "Hm. Or she could hide underground or something... No, I'd definitely have noticed that. We should go back and check that note later, see if it's still there."

"It didn't seem like she'd gone back, but it's worth a try," Mami agrees, retracting her hand. "She... could have encountered a Witch Barrier where she disappeared?"

"It's my best guess at the moment," you agree. "Or someone with portals or teleportation grabbed her for some reason, like I said earlier."

"That's a possibility," Mami agrees. "I can't see why that would happen, though."

"Yeah," you say, scowling at nothing in particular.

"She didn't go *up*, she didn't go *down*, and she didn't go, ah, sideways," Mami muses, half to herself. She quirks a grin at you. "Maybe she travelled in time?"

You giggle. "At this point, I wouldn't rule it out," you agree. "Dammit, why'd Oriko have to lose her powers. She'd probably have foreseen this."

"Or... A Wish?" Mami says, smile widening a little. "Maybe someone Wished Kuroki were there with her, and... poof?"

You blink in surprise. "Huh. Possible," you concede, rubbing your chin thoughtfully as you zip towards the skyscrapers of downtown Mitakihara, gaining altitude rapidly. "I hadn't considered that. Good thinking, Mami."

Mami's delighted smile lights up her entire face. "Thank you, Sabrina," she says.

You tap her on the nose. "Mami, *you* are awesome. And unlike me, you don't even need to *cheat* to do it," you say, smiling warmly at her. "You're *you*, and there's no *just* about it."

Some of your conviction must have gotten through, because her smile softens into something you can't quite identify, and she curls into your embrace with a pleased little noise. "I... still. Thank you, Sabrina."

"Anytime, Mami," you say, tightening your arm a little. It's an idea. It might not actually be the correct idea, but it's *something*, and damned if you aren't going to take the opportunity to compliment Mami for it.

Mami seems more than happy enough to settle into the comfortable silence. And speaking of Kuroki, you should probably update Masami and Hiroko. Which reminds you in turn that you should probably check in on the Mikunis before you actually arrive there. Wouldn't want to interrupt another game of Scrabble or something. "*Hey Oriko, Kirika, you girls free?*"

"*Heya, Sabrina,*" Kirika chirps.

"*Hello, Sabrina,*" Oriko says. "*We are free, yes.*"

"*I'm doing the dishes!*" Kirika says.

"*Oh, cool,*" you say. "*Mind if I drop in? I have groceries and stuff for you, too.*"

"*By all means,*" Oriko says.

"*Alright, see you in a bit, then!*" you say.

"*See ya!*" Kirika responds.

Excellent. With that done, you turn your attention to Masami. "*Masami, Hiroko? Are you free?*"

It takes a moment for them to reply. "*Yep, hi Sabrina,*" Masami says. "*Hiroko's a little busy right now, but what's up?*"

"*Ah, hey, hope I'm not interrupting anything,*" you say.

"*Nah, we're good,*" Masami responds. "*Hiroko's putting Ono through her paces again.*"

"*Right, excellent,*" you say, feeling faintly relieved. You seem to have a track record of interrupting at... inopportune times. "*How's that going? Also, speaking of interruptions and before I forget, could I get your phone number so I can just SMS you?*"

"*Uh, sure,*" Masami says, rattling off her phone number. You memorise it for now - you'd rather not disturb Mami. "*Also, surprise training session. I got Hiroko to drop an illusion on her, we're seeing how well she's dealing with it. She hasn't noticed so far.*"

"*Hi!*" Hiroko chimes in, voice bright and amused despite the audible strain. "*Sorry, focusing. Big illusion. Thanks for the introduction to Miss Inoue.*"

You allow your amusement to bubble into a mental chuckle. "*Right, uh, I trust you girls know what you're doing,*" you say. "*How're *you* doing, speaking of?*"

"*Doing pretty great,*" Masami responds. "*You?*"

"*Not bad at all,*" you say. You've spent a fairly relaxing weekend, gotten plenty of productive things done today, and you have a Mami cuddled up against you. All in all, life is pretty good. "*Had a fairly busy day, but I got lots done.*"

"*Eurgh, busy Sundays,*" Masami opines. "*I kept Sunday free even when... y'know.*"

"*Hah, fair enough,*" you say, skimming a lazy spiral around the spire of the DBJ building to prompt a giggle from Mami. "*Anyway, speaking of being busy, I went and did a check on Kuroki's last location since I had some free time. I actually found a trail out to an old construction site, but it went cold there.*"

"*Hng,*" Masami says. "*Hope you didn't walk around there too much.*"

"*Uh... we did a bit? Why?*" you say.

"*Eh, Hiroko's got a trick with her illusions that makes tracks and stuff show up,*" Masami explains. "*We mostly use it to find Witches, but since you asked us to look into it...*"

"*Dang, sorry. Didn't know,*" you say.

"*'s fine, just kinda a bitch picking out footprints and stuff. What size do you wear?*" Masami asks.

"*Uh...twenty-three cm, twenty-five and a half,*" you say.

"*Gotcha,*" Masami says. "*We'll check it out.*"

"*Alright. Good luck, and thanks for helping!*" you say. "*See you around?*"

"*Yep,*" Masami responds. "*See ya.*"

"*Bye!*" Hiroko says.

You end the conversation. Mami seems to sense that, cuddling closer with a happy sigh. You're only a few minutes out from the Mikunis' place, anyway, cruising smoothly and rapidly descending.

It occurs to you that Oriko might actually take Kirika's surname when they marry. It's not like Oriko's particularly enamoured of her family, after all.

You land neatly in their back yard, parking your flight disc squarely on top of the hole you'd left by uprooting one of the departed senator's rosebushes. The flowers are still dying slowly to the side, leaves withering and flowers drooping to the ground.

Kirika's already shoving the glass door open, a welcoming grin on her face. "Yo."

"Yo!" you greet in kind, raising an eyebrow at her attire as Mami uncurls herself from your embrace to stand. "Nice apron."

Kirika looks down at the frilly apron. "It's Oriko's, actually," she says, brushing unruly bangs out of her face and grinning at you. "Like I said, I was doing the dishes."

Oriko herself emerges a few moments behind Kirika, smiling faintly as she straightens her blouse with her single hand. She seems to be in good spirits, all things considered. "Hello, Sabrina," she says. "Miss Tomoe."

"Miss Mikuni, Miss Kure," Mami says, nodding regally in response. "I hope you're well?"

"Well enough," Oriko agrees. "Please, come in."

You hook the plastic bags holding their share of the groceries up with Grief and follow her into the house. The rest you leave with the platform - you'll be leaving the same way, anyway. You cast a surreptitious eye around as you walk. Weird relationship or not, you *do* kind of want to offer your help cleaning up and such if they need it, but... It's surprisingly clean in here. Not too much dust, at least. You can only assume that Kirika does some cleanup.

"Here's the groceries," you say, letting the bags drift forward on Grief as you enter the living room. "Uh, Kirika, show me where to put these?"

"Sure\~" Kirika says, bending down to give Oriko a kiss on the cheek before darting off to the kitchen.

You follow her, smiling. "You're in a good mood."

"Mmmhm\~" Kirika says, and motions at the counter, still slightly wet. Dishes sit in the drying rack, still dripping slowly. "Here will do."

"Alright," you say, setting the groceries down. All but one bag, that is. "And *these* are your date supplies. Hope I got everything in here."

Kirika blushes, just a little. "Gimme that," she says, snatching the bag from you and hurrying off to tuck it high up in a cabinet. She pushes a box of cereal in front of the bag, hiding it from easy view.

You grin at her. "Enjoy."

"I've got Oriko," she says, fang protruding with her sly grin. "You bet I will."

"Attagirl," you say. "Oh, on that note, could I get your phone number? So I can SMS you instead of... interrupting you?"

Kirika scowls at you, folding her arms. "What's with the pause."

"Nothing?" you say, raising your eyebrows.

"Oriko's a sore loser sometimes," Kirika says, cracking a smirk. "Don't tell her I said that. Yeah, you can have my phone number."

She rattles the number off, and you take both her and Masami's numbers down on your phone before heading back out to the living room. You find Mami and Oriko making somewhat uncomfortable smalltalk, and Mami's gaze turns to you almost before you emerge through the doorway, face lighting up with a warm smile. You head over to join her on the sofa, nodding your thanks as Oriko pours you a steaming cup of green tea.

OK I'll be honest, I'm not sure about the shoe sizes of teenaged girls. I'll edit if someone can tell me that they're wrong. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

Also, cut the vote off here because it was frankly getting rather long.

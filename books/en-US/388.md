# Residue processing pt. 23.1

"Good night, Mami," you say, closing your eyes.

You're asleep almost immediately.

\==="Rubble slams down all around, great boulders of concrete falling to the earth with reverberating thuds. Rebar and girders protrude irregularly to form a forest of deadly spars.

A pair of hands, small and pale, with a rhomboid-cut amethyst set into the back of one, scrabble against the ground. Knees slam down onto the broken rubble underfoot with sharp cracks of bone on concrete.

Lurid light glares from the sky, shrouded by a twilight storm that should not be. Enough light to cast everything in spidery shadows skittering across the wreckage of the city.

Wychfire, *Witch* fire, burns in coruscating, rainbow gouts across the sky.

Blistering rain slashes across the city, driven by the bitterly cold wind. Concrete dust and shattered glass and dirt mixes into slurry, slick underfoot.

Dead, yawning silence swallows up the hammering of the rain."===

You wake up, sweaty and uneasy. A lingering feeling of... oddness... settles in on you, and you can't shake the feeling that you've forgotten something.

Them sneaky url tags.

# Direct Intervention pt. 16

You let the smirk fade from your face, and glance at Mami. "So, on a *completely unrelated* note," you begin in a perfectly level voice, "maybe it's *time* go and find something to eat?"

Mami nods, one hand coming up to cover her mouth. "Yes, I agree."

"How about it, Homura? I'm sure we can spare the time," you address the black haired girl.

She glares at you, but relents quickly. "Fine." She raises her shield, and with a clicking of the gears, produces an instant ramen cup, which she tosses to you, and a second one to Mami.

You reflexively catch the cup of instant noodles, as does Mami. She looks down at the plastic cup with an unhappy frown, turning it over in her hands. Homura sits at the edge of the roof, facing in, and puts down her cup beside her, before reaching behind her shield again. This time, she produces a... what the hell, Homura?

Your thoughts grind to a halt as the time traveller pulls a kettle, with steam still wafting from the spout, from behind her shield. "Open the cup noodles," Homura instructs with a hint of irritation and a slight gesture with the kettle. Neither you nor Mami have moved to open your cup noodles, and she looks *dismayed* to have to eat instant food.

"*No*, Homura," Mami says firmly, looking up at her.

"It's the middle of the night, it's cold, we're h- hunting a dangerous magical girl..." she reels off. "We'd all feel better if we had something that *isn't* instant food, Homura."

Homura sighs, closing her eyes for a moment, but eventually seems to come to the decision that it's not worth the effort to try and dissuade Mami. When she reopens her violet eyes, she grits out, "Fine. What do you suggest, then?" The kettle is returned to her shield, and she reclaims the instant noodles.

"My apartment," Mami says firmly. "We should check it, in any case, and perhaps yours too, after we eat. I believe I should be able to cook something even with the timestop."

Homura raises one shoulder in a minute shrug, and makes a little 'go ahead' gesture with her hand. There's a tiny, tiny quirk of what might be a nostalgic smile on her face as she watches Mami turn to lead the way back to her apartment, though, that you might've missed had you not been watching her closely.

The three of you arrive at Mami's apartment without incident, or stumbling across errant magical girls along the way. The door is opened with some trepidation by Mami, but everything turns out to be normal and undisturbed.

Mami peers down at the boots of her magical girl outfit, before dismissing them in a flash of golden light and walking into the apartment. You raise an eyebrow at her, and frown down at your own boots. You've *just* seen a practical demonstration, so... ah.

Your own boots disappear, too, and you walk into the apartment, past Mami, who's holding the door open. "Come in, Homura," she invites.

The black haired time traveller hesitates for a moment, but dismisses her high heeled shoes and walks in.

"OK!" Mami says, closing the door behind Homura. "I'll just prepare something simple, then," she says, moving to the kitchen with ribbons blossoming out ahead of her.

Why *wouldn't* Homura carry a kettle of boiling water?

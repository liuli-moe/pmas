# To the White Forest pt. 12

"Me," you say, mind awhirl with responses. You settle for a smile -courteous, bland, maybe a touch apologetic- and a sigh. "Miss Airi, this is Tsuruya Yuki, from Fukushima. I've made arrangements for you to stay with them."

"Ah, so you're just throwing me aside like a piece of trash," Anri says. "Nice! I guess I was just that insignificant."

She grins at you, too sharp, too bright. Fever-bright. Her eyes track you as you give Mami's hand a squeeze and release it to step forward into the room, and you're not so naïve you don't watch your breathing, even with the antimagic on her. You remember what she did, back in Asunaro. Grief fog blankets the room, a light touch but subtle threat held poised and ready.

And as much as anything else, you're terrified of what she might blurt out, with Mami here. One of the biggest reasons you need to get Anri *away* is to keep the nature of Witches away from Mami and Sayaka and Madoka.

"Nah. You're not insignificant," you say. If anything, she's *too* significant, for what she knows. "The simple fact is that I don't have the facilities to keep you held here, so I'm hiring people who *do*. I have no intention of just leaving you there, either - I *will* be visiting."

You smile, and continue by telepathy. "*I haven't forgotten the deal, either - I intend to honour it.*"

Anri doesn't say anything, just grins at you.

"Well," you say, and exhale slowly. "Miss Tsuruya?"

She nods at you, eyeing Airi carefully as she steps into the room. The chains clink, resting as they are over her shoulder. "*That manacle is antimagic?*" she asks.

"*Yeah,*" you say, backing away. "*Steel. Should be pretty hard to pry off. By the way, can we schedule a time for the, uh, sharing of your contact list?*"

"*Certainly,*" Yuki says. "*How does the weekend sound?*"

"*Should be good,*" you agree, and turn to Rin and Sakura. You give both of them a broad smile. "Rin, Miss Tachibana... sincerely, thank you for helping today."

"It was our pleasure, Sabrina," Rin says. You can't help but notice the way she grips Sakura's elbow in warning, granted. "Farewell!"

"See you sometime soon," you say, and step aside to let them into the room. "You too, Miss Tsuruya!"

"Indeed!" Yuki agrees, smirking at you. "Have Miss Akemi contact me when she has the location ready for claiming!"

"Can do," you agree. You watch as Yuki grips Sakura's arm, other hand on Anri's shoulder.

And with a quiet *vwwp*, they're gone.

You blow out a breath, and let yourself relax. She's gone, along with her inconvenient facts of life. Mami cuddles up against your side, a worried frown creasing her brow and silent question on her face. You smile at her, reassuring and warm. You're fine.

You straighten.

"Hey, Oriko, Kirika?" you say, and beam at them. "Thank you both so much for today. You both did a great job. Not just this whole mess with Airi, but just... for everything."

"Thank *you*, Sabrina," Oriko says, inclining her head. "It was a good experience."

"So, uh... before we head off, I've got a few things," you say.

"By all means?" Oriko says, and gestures back towards the living room.

You follow her down the corridor, taking a few seconds to marshal your thoughts. "So uh... first thing. Would you like me to clean up the graffiti on the outside?"

Oriko blinks slowly at you. "Yes, that would be nice, if unnecessary," she says.

"Alright, cool," you say, Grief fog already moving to your will. Really, you just need to scrape it away. Shouldn't be too hard. "I'll get that done before I leave, then."

"Thank you," Oriko says, inclining her head.

"So... second," you say. You've reached the living room, and you'd take a seat, but you're just about to leave. Not much point sitting down again. "Kirika, could I ask a favour? And I'm sorry to put it on you after everything I've already asked of you today."

"Mm?" Kirika says, blinking bright orange eyes at you.

"Could you help me check some IRCs?" you ask. "I've got the addresses of a couple of magical girl IRCs from Nadia."

Oriko purses her lips. "Are you sure you should be giving those to us?" she asks. "After all, we *are* under house arrest, nominally to keep me from plotting against you. I would rather... not hand Miss Akemi more metaphorical ammunition. She certainly has enough literal ammunition as it is."

"I... guess that's fair," you say, biting your lip in thought. Yeah, you can see Homura being unhappy about that. It's not like Oriko couldn't have found them out beforehand, were she truly plotting against you, but it's about *trust*. And Homura's extended you so much already as it is. "Yeah. I... thanks."

Oriko inclines her head slowly, sea-green eyes steady and unflinching. Mami tucks herself under your arm to hug you.

"Right." You blow out a slow, careful breath, and smile at Oriko. "Last thing. Are you, uh... OK with the 'Kures' thing?"

Oriko stumbles. *Oriko* stumbles, and flushes a bright, instant red, a shade only rivalled by Kirika, who makes a high-pitched squeal and clings even tighter to Oriko's arm.

Mami giggles. It's infectious, and you find yourself smothering your own giggles as you turn to face them properly. As amusing and *utterly adorable* as it is... you don't really want to belabour the joke if you're making them uncomfortable.

"Y-yes," Oriko manages. "Yes, I- we're fine with it."

Kirika *squeals* and pulls Oriko into a clinging hug.

You grin at Mami, a little red yourself. "Shall we give them a moment? Or... the rest of the day?" you ask.

"Oh, *Sabrina*," Mami says, taking your hand and towing you towards the glass doors.

"Well, see you two later!" you call over your shoulder. You don't get any answer, sliding the doors shut and giving the exterior walls a quick once-over. A good job, you think, white paint untouched but graffiti removed. The only traces remaining are where the vandals scored deep enough to carve into the wooden finish itself.

Mami smiles at you. "Fly us home?"

"I'll fly us halfway," you say, winking at her and opening your arms. "And, mm... invite everyone over for the practice session?"

"Definitely," Mami agrees, giving you a brilliant smile and transforming before stepping into the offered hug.

You close your arms around her, one arm around her waist and one around her shoulders to pull her close as wings bloom from your shoulders, rippling out across the garden. A single powerful stroke lofts you airborne, Mami holding tight in your embrace.

"*Hey, everyone,*" you call out across the ether of telepathy. Mami, of course, and Homura and Sayaka and Madoka and Hitomi. Your friends. "*Enchantment practice at Mami's apartment, if everyone has the time, and Madoka, Hitomi - you're invited if you want to come along!*"

"*Ah... maybe not?*" Madoka says hesitantly. "*I haven't been at club for ages! And I already told mama and papa I'd be home for dinner tonight... I'm sorry!*"

"*Ah, that's fine,*" you say. "*Um... Hitomi?*"

"*Similarly, I feel beholden to stay for club activities,*" Hitomi says. "*And I am expected home for dinner, too.*"

"*Yeah, uh... ditto for dinner?*" Sayaka says hesitantly. "*Sorry. I'll head over soon, though!*"

"*Oh, don't be ridiculous,*" you say. "*Don't apologise. It just means more of Mami's cooking for me! Homura, what about you?*"

"*I will be there,*" Homura murmurs.

"*Alright, excellent,*" you say. "*Don't worry about it, Madoka, Hitomi. Also, uh, quick update - the meeting with Miss Tsuruya went well, and I think we're all quite hopeful about the alliance. Things look good!*"

"*Oh, thank goodness!*" Madoka says. "*It's great that everyone's getting along!*"

"*It is,*" Hitomi agrees.

You chat with them for a few more minutes, giving them a few quick details before signing off. You beam at Mami, her face so close to yours. Her hair streams out in whipping strands of perfect, flaxen gold as she meets your eyes and smiles back. You don't bother shouting over the boom of your wings or the roar of the wind, and instead you breathe words into her mind.

"*Looks like we'll get a quiet night at home tonight after everything,*" you say.

"*It would be nice to have some peace,*" Mami says. "*After last night's excitement.*"

"*Yeah, it would,*" you say, your smile softening as your wings carry you higher over the city, away from the bustle and noise of the millions of people.

You savour the peace.

"*Penny for your thoughts, Sabrina?*" Mami asks, watching your eyes.

"*Many things,*" you say. "*Thinking about our friends, about math, about the future, and about magic.*"

"*Oh?*" Mami asks, tightening her arms a little around you.

"*I *am* lucky to have the friends I do,*" you say softly. "*And I'm lucky to have you.*"

"*I'm lucky to have *you*,*" Mami says, smiling.

You'd duck your head, but you're kind of carrying Mami right now. Instead, you give her a sheepish grin, that's maybe just a touch abashed. "*And... I haven't talked to Nagisa in a while,*" you say. "*Should spend a bit of time to catch up with her sometime.*"

"*I'm sure she's busy settling into her new home,*" Mami says. "*You're a good person, Sabrina.*"

"*I try to be,*" you say.

"*You are,*" Mami insists.

"*Thank you, Mami,*" you say, returning her smile. What can you say, in the face of the unwavering faith in the way she looks at you?

The conversation lapses for a minute or two, before Mami speaks again. "*What about the math?*"

"*Oh, um, well...*" you say, glancing aside. "*So, uh... are you familiar with the Banach-Tarski paradox?*"

"*Ah... broadly? I've heard about it, but we'll only be taught set theory next year,*" Mami says. "*It's a neat trick, but I don't really understand it yet.*"

You blink at her. Set theory. Anywhere else, you'd call it university level math, but this is *Mitakihara*.

... To be fair, you're not sure what education standards are like elsewhere. Hm.

"*Sabrina?*" Mami prompts.

You shake off the disbelief, and grin at her. "*Well, the long and the short of it is that if I have a mathematically ideal object consisting of an uncountable infinity of points, I can split it into *two* objects that are exactly the same as the initial one, right? Because infinities are weird.*"

"*Mmmhm?*" Mami says.

"*Well... the thing is, I've noticed that Grief is... strange,*" you say. Understatement right there, right up next to 'Homura's a bit fussy about Madoka's wellbeing'. "*And in some ways it does behave like mathematically ideal... stuff.*"

"*So you want to try and see if you can realise the Banach-Tarski paradox?*" Mami hazards. "*And... multiply your Grief?*"

"*Yep,*" you say. "*I have no idea what'll happen.*"

Mami giggles, and cuddles into your arms. "*Don't blow up the universe.*"

"*I won't,*" you say. "*It's where Mami is, after all.*"

Mami blushes a rosy pink, ducking her head against the crook of your neck. Her face is warm against your skin.

The next few minutes pass in a comfortable silence as you soar onwards and upwards, towards the halfway mark over Mitakihara City, as promised.

"*Are you ready?*" you ask Mami, smiling.

"*I am,*" Mami says, returning the smile. You can feel her magic tightening.

You let her go, trusting her.

And she falls for just seconds, before her own wings ripple into existence, bright gold slashing across the afternoon light. They practically glow under the sun, a brilliant mirror to your own wings, and you laugh as she catches the wind and *soars*.

You glide alongside her, wingtip to wingtip, and your delighted laughter joins hers as you fly back home together. You tumble down the stairs together, hand-in-hand and still a touch breathless with the simple delight as you pile back into the apartment, flopping down on the sofa.

Homura and Sayaka aren't here yet - still watching Madoka and lingering with Kaoiske, if you had to guess. That gives you time to relax, though, and perhaps brainstorm a little.

"Say, Mami?" you ask.

"Yes, Sabrina?" She doesn't lift her head, draped comfortably over you.

"So... I want to give Oriko and Kirika a bit more freedom, yeah?" you say.

"I remember," Mami says.

"Right, so... I've been thinking a bit over it. As it is, the house arrest works by two things: one, Oriko's goodwill, and two, the fact that it's a known location that we can check. If they're not there, then we know they've broken the arrest, right?" you say, waving a hand in the air.

Mami's silent for a moment, thinking it over. "I... think I see where you're going," she agrees.

"Yeah. So... if we put some kind of tracker on them, it establishes essentially the same effect?" you say slowly. "It creates a known way for us to *check* on them at will, but gives them freedom."

Mami nods slowly, her hair rustling over your shirt. "But Homura's fear isn't only that of not knowing where they are," she says. "It's of... what manipulations they might set up, correct?"

"Mmm," you agree, frowning.

"So the tracker would let us check on them," Mami agrees hesitantly. "But the freedom means that Miss Mikuni could leave her house, talk to people, and set plans in motion, correct? She has a considerable fortune still, even if she has lost her powers of foresight. If she decided to, she could still do considerable damage."

"That's a fair point," you say, and grimace unhappily. "Do you think it can be done, though?"

"Certainly," Mami agrees. "It should be doable with enchantment... I could work on it later!"

"Do you know if there's a way to do it by mundane means as well?" you ask. "It might be more... reassuring to have some kind of doubly-guaranteed method."

"A personal tracker?" Mami asks, considering. "You could... probably purchase one online?"

"Huh," you say. "Point."

"And..." Mami hesitates for a second. "Sayaka might not be happy regardless. Her concern is in punishing Miss Mikuni and Miss Kure for burning down her house, isn't it?"

"Yeah," you agree with a sigh. "I figure... I need to try and convince her that justice has *already* been served, which is a tall order, or help her sympathise with Oriko's position, which is... possible, maybe, but it'd take a miracle."

"Perhaps if we convince her that Oriko can be punished by... community service?" Mami suggests. Her tone suggests she doesn't think it too likely. "That her excursions with us are part of her sentence?"

"Maybe," you agree, and fall silent to ruminate on it.

# Anomalous Materials pt. 6

"*It's Darija,*" you say, looking around again. You'll go and check out warehouse-kun, you think, and see if Mami's idea had any merit. "*Otherwise known as Maghrebi Arabic. It's... among the many, many languages I apparently speak.*"

"*Oh?*" Mami asks, a trace of worry edging her voice.

"*Yeah,*" you say, striding over to the edge of the roof. Grief spheres dissolve, your wings cutting swathes through the sky behind you. "*I... I can speak a lot of languages. Posso parlare italiano!*"

"*Oh,*" Mami says, now sounding more confused than anything. "*I... is this part of your memories?*"

"*Yeah,*" you say as you launch yourself you skywards. "*Um... It just sort of comes naturally to me.*"

"*Oh,*" Mami says. "*I... do you remember anything else, Sabrina?*"

"*No, not at all,*" you admit. You have *ideas* of where you might have come from, but... You don't remember. You don't *know* for sure. "*Just things that I know how to do.*"

"*Ah...*" Mami says. "*I'm sorry.*"

"*No, don't be,*" you say. Wingbeats thunder through the skies behind you as you soar towards the sun - eastwards, to the warehouse. "*Mami... honestly, I'm not that worried. I have a life here, wherever I may have come from. And it's with you, and everyone else.*"

"*Alright,*" Mami whispers. "*I just... I'm worried.*"

"*I know,*" you say. "*I'm here with you, right?*"

"*You are,*" she agrees. "*I... yes. You are.*"

"*Good,*" you say emphatically. "*Now, how are you feeling?*"

Mami seems to take a breath, rallying. "*I... not too bad. What are you doing right now? Um. If I may ask?*"

"*Of course,*" you say firmly. "*And well, I'm going to go out and check on warehouse-kun.*" Your eyes widen. "*Uh-*"

"\*Warehouse-\*kun?" Mami asks.

"*Yeah, um, I've been using this abandoned warehouse for experiments,*" you say, rushing through the words. "*So, well, I nicknamed it warehouse-kun.*"

"*And it's just a warehouse?*" Mami asks.

"*Yeah,*" you say. "*Just a warehouse.*"

"*... oh, Sabrina,*" Mami says fondly. You get the impression she'd be shaking her head at you, were you actually face to face. "*You never change.*"

"*Hey, I wouldn't be me if I weren't a *bit* silly,*" you protest. Privately, you're just glad you seem to have distracted Mami from the thoughts about your facility with language.

"*That's true,*" Mami says.

"*Hmhmmm...*" you muse as you soar eastwards, banking in a lazy curve towards the old industrial district. This early, there aren't any good thermals yet, and you're having to rely a little more on direct Grief impulse rather than actual aerodynamics to gain altitude.

"*Mmm, Sabrina?*" Mami asks.

"*I was just thinking out loud,*" you say. "*Oh! I had a thought - do you think we could make patatas bravas for the picnic tomorrow, maybe?*"

"*Ah... patatas... bravas?*" Mami asks, stumbling over the unfamiliar words.

"*It's Spanish, I think,*" you explain. "*Lightly fried potato, with a savoury and slightly spicy tomato sauce? It's quite simple to make, and talking to Miss Bennouna made me think of it.*"

"*That sounds good,*" Mami says. "*We could try that! Um... Isn't Miss Bennouna Moroccan, though?*"

"*She is,*" you agree as you wing past that one flue stack. It's practically a landmark by now. "*Still!*"

"*... alright, then,*" Mami says. She... sounds better. A touch more cheerful.

"*Mmmm,*" you say, banking a little to the left.

"*Ah, Sabrina?*" Mami asks. "*What are you checking warehouse-*kun* for, anyway?*"

"*Well,*" you say, grinning. "*Remember when you suggested that maybe Witches would be drawn to my experiments? Like calls to like, and all that? I've been mostly doing those at the warehouse, so I thought I should double-check the area.*"

"*I see!*" Mami says. "*Um... be careful if you *do* find any Witches, alright?*"

"*I will,*" you promise. "*I'll be careful.*"

"*Alright,*" Mami says. "*I... should pay attention to class. Be safe, alright?*"

"*I will, Mami,*" you say. "*I'll see you at lunch, OK? Promise. And you can always talk to me.*"

"*See you soon, Sabrina,*" Mami says.

"*See you!*" you respond, closing the call. Reaching the warehouse, you start flying a large, looping spiral over the largely abandoned warehouses and metalyards below. Even up here, you can *smell* the tang of rusting metal in the air, wisping curls of dust trickling over the ground far beneath as a faint breeze stirs.

*Is* there any truth to Mami's idea that the experiments might be drawing in Witches? That would certainly be... unfortunate, especially considering that you've been using the same Witch-stuff at Oriko's house. Hm. Something to consider, maybe. And it'd be a rather worrying trend, if your powers *attract* Witches, an-

Speak of the devil.

You suck in a breath, wings backing air as you draw to a hover. You can feel a Witch... not even three minutes into your search. The abyssal, swirling morass that is a Barrier entrance lurks in what looks like, from where you are, an old metalworks factory.

Hm. It's a Witch... but there's few enough people around here that you could probably afford to leave it alone for now. Or you could just handle it quickly.

# "We Don't Go To Asunaro..." pt. 18

You gape. That's really the only word for it - you gape at her, mouth hanging open as your brain races to catch up. But then, you already kind of have plans in your head, thoughts crystallising into chains of logic and arguments. What to tell her, for, against, but you know what?

This is a *good* thing.

An adult who's... somewhat in on it. You're kind of curious as to how she managed to avoid being mindwiped -the best explanation you've got is that Ritsuko asked Kyuubey not to- but she's an adult who seems sympathetic, and she has a tie to you, if indirectly. This *is* a good thing.

You blow out a breath, and squeeze Mami's hand. You draw comfort from the contact, and nod at Mrs Shizuki.

"I see," you say. "She sounds like she was a good friend."

"She was," Mrs Shizuki says with a faint smile. "I wish I hadn't lost contact with her, but these things happen. Regardless... Seeing Sayaka reminded me of the, ah, Soul Gems? That's what the ring is, right? And the fingernail mark?"

You rub your thumb against said mark. "Yes to the former. I admit, I'm actually uncertain what the mark is... Mami, do you have any idea?"

She glances down at her own hand, fingers interlaced with yours. "I never thought about it!" she admits with a laugh. "It's... just a pattern. All magical girls have it."

"I see!" Mrs Shizuki says. "Just to be sure, Hitomi isn't a magical girl, right?"

And there you are: that's probably what she was worried about. *This* you can readily answer, rather than worry about whether to tell her about the Witch bomb and other such nasties. You can keep this light, and you don't want to upset Mami. You kind of want to recruit Mrs Shizuki to your cause, but perhaps not yet.

"She is not," Mami answers for you. "She's a good friend, but she does not have the potential to become a magical girl."

"I think I was told that, too," Mrs Shizuki says, sounding faintly amused. Something about her posture seems to ease, her shoulders squaring. "Being the friend of a magical girl -but never actually a magical girl- seems to run in the family. Maybe I should ask my mother... Regardless, I mean no offense, but I am glad my daughter isn't a magical girl."

"None taken," you say, straightening. "I agree, Mrs Shizuki. Being a magical girl isn't the fantastic life media makes it out to be. We have to fight for our lives, constantly." You pause, chewing your lip thoughtfully. "To pre-empt a question, we do not bring Hitomi on our hunts, either."

"Against Witches," Mrs Shizuki says, completing the sentence. "I'm glad. To acquire... Grief Seeds?"

"Yes," you say, holding up your hand and letting your Soul Gem shimmer into its egg form. Mrs Shizuki leans forward, staring at the blatant display of magic. "This is my Soul Gem... Actually, Mrs Shizuki, would you like to bring your husband over?"

The older woman purses her lips, wrinkles crinkling. "Not now, we can't interrupt his call. However, I *would* appreciate your assistance at a later time to help me explain."

"Does he know anything about magic?" you ask, dismissing your Soul Gem.

"Not at all," Mrs Shizuki says, smiling faintly. "Truthfully speaking, until recently, I had completely forgotten it."

"Really?" you say, eyebrows arching. "Um, sorry - I don't mean to be rude."

"No offense taken," Mrs Shizuki reassures you. "I *had* forgotten. It's been a long time."

You exhale, nodding. "You said your friend let you tag along on hunts, right? How much do you remember of those?"

"I remember them being terrifyingly strange," Mrs Shizuki admits. "Eldritch might be the best word. They were *monsters*, simply, that preyed on people, and magical girls fought to protect people. It's noble."

"And Witches drop Grief Seeds," you say. "We need the Grief Seeds to cleanse our Soul Gem, wiping away the corruption we build up from using magic."

"I see," Mrs Shizuki says, frowning. "Not entirely altruistic, then."

"No," Mami says, sharp steel lacing her voice. "We fight to keep people *safe*. Many magical girls do not, and they are *wrong*."

Mrs Shizuki's eyes flick from you to Mami, and she hesitates for a moment before inclining her head. "I understand. I apologise for any offense I may have caused."

Mami nods regally. You squeeze her hand, sneaking a smile at her.

"Am I right to imagine it like being a firefighter or maybe... perhaps a soldier?" Mrs Shizuki asks. "There is pay, of sorts, but to those who truly belong in the role, the pay isn't the primary reason to do it."

"That's a reasonable analogy," Mami agrees. "Grief Seeds are a necessity, but they are not *why* we fight."

"A necessity..." Mrs Shizuki muses. "You use them to cleanse your Soul Gems. Your magic runs out if they fill up, right?"

"No," Mami says, pressing her lips together. "Yes. I... Sabrina?"

"The term *Soul* Gem is unfortunately literal," you say crisply. You cover Mami's hand with yours, trying to convey as much reassurance as you can. "Kyuubey is a disingenuous obfuscator who does *not* tell prospective magical girls about that."

Mrs Shizuki's eyes go wide, hand rising to cover her mouth. "I- I see. I-" she swallows. "I *see*. So all of you..."

You nod, releasing Mami's hand so you can wrap your arms around her, propriety be damned. She burrows into your side, and you hug her tight. You don't get it, you admit. It's a cultural thing, but the *soul* is held in rather more reverence than you yourself accord it. Your Soul is safe, and in your possession. It feels sufficient to you, but not to others.

"Well," Mrs Shizuki says, visibly gathering herself. "I see. I am... doubly glad that Hitomi is not a magical girl, I suppose."

You can't exactly blame her for that, can you?

Silence falls for a few minutes before she shakes her head. "I apologise," she says. "I'm being a terrible host."

"No, no, not at all," you say. "It was my fault for bringing this up."

"I disagree," Mrs Shizuki says, smiling faintly. "And as your host, my word is law."

"... that's not how it works," you say, recognising the attempt at lightening the mood. "Mami, is that how it works?"

"It is if Mrs Shizuki says it is," Mami answers, managing a giggle despite herself. She tightens her grip around your arm.

"Bah, fine," you say, shaking your head. "Mrs Shizuki, if I may ask, what did you hope to find out by pulling us aside?"

"Truthfully, I was indulging my curiosity," she says. "Magic is... I had almost dismissed those memories as youthful fantasies, you know? It's so unbelievable. But then, seeing the ring on Sayaka, and then my daughter's friends..."

She glances at you, eyes piercing. "Kamijou Kyousuke's miraculous recovery wasn't simply a miracle, was it?"

"Oh no, it absolutely was," you say, smiling. "Magic *does* make miracles come true. It comes with a steep cost, granted."

"Magic exists," Mrs Shizuki murmurs, almost to herself. "Huh. Are there magical girls in, ah, business?"

"That is an *excellent* question," you say. "I feel like there *should* be, but I don't know. Mami?"

She shakes her head. "If there are, they keep it quiet," Mami says. "Magic... magic is a secret, after all."

"That makes sense, I suppose. Though I suspect savvy magical girls could make a *killing* out there," Mrs Shizuki agrees, standing and extending a hand. "Thank you for indulging an old lady's curiosity. I'll ask my daughter to pass a message sometime, possibly this weekend? Fujio -my husband- deserves to know."

You stand too, shaking her hand and smiling. "I'd be happy to."

"I'm glad my daughter has the opportunity to know you, Miss Sabrina, Miss Tomoe," Mrs Shizuki says. "Even learning that magic has its darker side, it wouldn't do for her life to be absent some wonder. I don't think I could have asked for someone better to introduce her. You've given me plenty to think about, and between you and me, healing young Kamijou has made my daughter very happy."

She winks, and you laugh. "She's a good friend, too," you say. "Truthfully, having, ah, mundane friends helps to ground us, I feel."

"Thank you for saying so, Mrs Shizuki," Mami says, dipping her head. She doesn't separate from your side, tucked snugly under your arm. "But I concur with Sabrina. Your daughter has been a good friend to us."

"Oh, flatter her to her face," the older woman says, waving. She seems amused, if pensive thanks to the revelations. "Go join your friends, I'll have the maid bring up some snacks."

"Alright, thank you!" you say. "Oh, one last thing. Would you mind if I told Hitomi that you know?"

Mrs Shizuki makes a face, but nods. "I won't ask you to keep it from her. I'll tell her later, regardless."

"Alright!" you say, smiling at Mami. She manages a warm smile for you, and cuddles up against your side as you make your way up the stairs.

When you make it to Hitomi's room after an arduous trek across carpeted luxury, you're greeted with a thrown paper ball to the face.

"Sayaka!" Madoka scolds.

Your friends are all splayed out on the floor, lying about in a loose ring. Even Hitomi's flopped down, notes, worksheets and pencilcase laid out neatly in front of her. Sayaka's propped up on a pile of pillows and tearing off more paper to ball up, grinning up at you.

Hitomi's room is *gigantic*. Her four-poster, canopied bed doesn't even take up most of the room, a dresser in the corner and a shelf of books in the other, lining the lavender floral print of the walls. She also has a shelf of soft toys, and grand curtains drawn over what must be a commanding view of the city through the windows.

"Hey, everyone!" you say, beaming as you bat away the next projectile. Mami giggles as you all exchange greetings.

"So what did Hitomi's mom want?" Sayaka asks, scooting aside to make room for you and Mami between herself and Kazumi.

"Ah. Well, Hitomi, it turns out your mother knows about magical girls," you say.

The room goes dead silent. You savour it, soaking in the baffled stares. Even Homura looks flummoxed. She looks *especially* flummoxed, eyes fixed on you as you lie down next to Sayaka, Mami immediately following suit and snuggling up against your side.

You steal a pillow from the pile Sayaka's using to prop herself up.

"What," Hitomi says, finally.

Mami giggles.

"You heard me," you say, beaming from ear to ear.

"*What*," Hitomi repeats.

"When she was our age, she knew a magical girl named Tsuchiya Ritsuko," you say. "But she was never a potential herself, so..."

"*What*," Hitomi repeats yet again.

"I know, it's a horrible thought, isn't it," you say, letting the smile disappear from your face. "Teenagers eventually grow into *adults*. We're like, some kind of larval form for them."

Sayaka groans, and buries her face in the stack of pillows.

"I mean, just imagine, some day we're going to be the ones sitting down to... I don't know, what is adulting? Filling out a stack of tax forms?" you muse, and fake a shiver. "Ew."

Kazumi giggles.

"Oh my god stop," Sayaka complains. "Madoka, make her stop."

You laugh cheerfully. "But yeah, that's what she wanted to talk to us about," you say, and worm your left arm about so you can raise your hand. "She recognised our fingernail marks and the ring."

"I... see," Hitomi says, blinking.

"You know, she said that a lot, too," you say, snickering. "Also, don't you blame her for not telling you. She barely remembered Miss Tsuchiya, since they lost contact after a year and that was... what, thirty years ago?"

"Ah," Hitomi says, pursing her lips. "I... I should talk to her later."

"Yup!" you say, beaming. "I told her the basics."

"I can't deal with this," Sayaka groans into the pillows. "I'm gonna do some homework. Sabrina, Mami says you're good with math, help me with this." She shoves her worksheet at you.

"Hm... this is just differentiation," you say. "Pencil? Thanks. You'll want to express the root like this, and then use the chain rule..."

Beside you, Mami squirms about, pulling her homework from her bag, too. She doesn't stray far, just enough to get a little elbow room for her to write, and you drape a fond arm around her shoulders as she works.

"Say, Umika, what can you tell me about your book, anyway?" you ask, smiling. "I'll pick up a copy when it comes out!"

"Which one? Sky of Seven Stars?" Umika says.

"Yup," you confirm.

"Well..."

It turns out that the story is a post-apocalyptic story, for some reason, centering around a girl who travels across the land with her companions, righting wrongs. Conversation segues from there, flowing into discussion of the plot, other stories, postcolonial and postmodern narratives... Kazumi and Kaoru interject, as do Hitomi and Madoka and Mami. Evidently literary critique is *also* something covered at Mitakihara.

Because of *course* it is.

You roll over at some point, elbows sore from supporting your weight. Of course, this puts you in the perfect position to toy with Mami's hair, walking your fingers through golden locks. She blushes, but doesn't object in the slightest.

You reach out to Homura, telepathically, and link Mami and Madoka in too for good measure. "*Hey, Homura? Madoka, Mami? If we all have a moment, could we have a private conversation? All four of us?*"

"*Now?*" Homura asks. You can feel her gaze on you, from across the circle.

"*Um... is something happening?*" Madoka asks. "*Um... I suppose I'm free! Let me finish this question...*"

"*Of course, Sabrina,*" Mami agrees. "*Ah, now? Or later?*"

No, system breaking wasn't brought up. The conversation simply didn't go that way, and there'll be opportunity later to bring it up. Like when Hitommy decides to have her husband read in too, so that I don't have to repeat the explanation twice. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# "We've Got Hostiles" pt. 12

You purse your lips and cup your chin, turning over the revelations. There's some uneasy shifting amongst the Ishinomaki girls as you do so, and you try to observe their reactions without being too obvious about it. There's more than a few wary glances towards the free floating Grief you still having drifting about, and the wings still billowing over your shoulders.

Mami stands placidly at your side, hands folded firmly across her chest and half lidded gaze sweeping across the Ishinomaki girls.

Kirika's bouncing happily on the balls of her feet, tapping her claws together with little *ting* noises. One-two-three, one-two-three...

"Hmm..." you shake errant thoughts of flocks of invading Incubators from your mind, and glance around at the Ishinomaki girls. "OK, look. I know that you won't have all the answers to my questions, but frankly, every bit helps. What can you tell me about Miss Kato? Why did she leave Sendai, what happened to her and so on?"

A sudden plague of shrugs strikes the trio you tentatively identify as the veterans of the Ishinomaki group - Aki, Kimiko, and Ayaka. they look around at each other, and Aki speaks up. "Dunno. You realize this was a long time ago, yeah? And we really only talked to her a little bit."

"Actually..." Kimiko says slowly. "You remember when we were asking if she wanted to join us?"

Aki shrugs again. "Nope. *You* just remember 'cuz she was pretty, don't you?"

"You know it," Kimiko agrees.

You cough lightly, drawing attention back to you.

"Aaaaaa*aaaanyway*," the lavender-haired girl says. "She said something about running from memories and stuff. Dunno what those memories *were*, but yeah. Something big happened back in Sendai."

You nod. "Thanks for that," you say. "Do you know why Miss Hamasaki would lash out like she did? Was she just an excuse or something?"

"Doubt Hamasaki thought she was pretty enough to start a war over," Kimiko shrugs.

That'd be a no, then. You'd expected as much. Next question, then... "What did she *do*, anyway? Come to that, what was she here for, today? If she wasn't here for negotiations...?"

Yuuki's lip curls. "I dunno. She *called* for a meeting, right, so I figured we should be the bigger person and agree. But then when we find her here early, skulking about and her two friends *also* skulking about... Like, wouldn't be the first time she's set up an ambush," she says, frowning.

"Sooo*oooo* it sounds like you guys attacked first?" Kirika pipes up, grin exposing her fang.

Yuuki's face hardens. "We did," she says. "If you were where *we* are, you would too."

Kirika merely grins and shrugs, still bouncing on her feet.

Mami tugs lightly at your elbow, and you turn to look at her. A small, troubled frown mars her face. "*Sabrina, didn't Miss Mori say that she was here to heal a Kato Setsuko, too? I thought maybe it was just a coincidence, but...*"

You frown equally. Now that she mentions it... "*You met... *a* Kato Setsuko before, right?*"

"*I did, yes, she passed through Mitakihara about two years ago,*" Mami says. "*She didn't want to stay...*" she trails off, looking crestfallen.

You lightly touch your hand to Mami's arm, and smile reassuringly at her. "*Do I need to tell you how wonderful you are again, Mami? Because I will.*"

She gives you a quick, grateful smile. "*No... I was just thinking... she was troubled, I think, is the best word to describe her.*"

"*Hmm...*" you say, glancing sidelong at the Ishinomaki girls, who are, by the looks of things, conducting their own telepathic conversations. Ayaka happens to be looking, too, her eyes rising from your hand on Mami's elbow to meet your gaze. "*Do you think it's just a coincidence, or are Sendai or Ishinomaki lying?*"

"*I think it's Sendai,*" Mami says. "*I don't... think much of Miss Hamasaki's conduct.*"

"*Hm,*" you repeat, and look back up at the Ishinomaki girls. "Are you aware of any independents living in Ishinomaki?"

"Yes?" Yuuki says. "Why?"

"Rin... uh, that's Mori Rin, one of the Sendai group, said she was here to heal one of the independents."

Yuuki cocks her head to the side. "That so? Hold up a minute..."

"*Hey, Nakano,*" Yuuki's voice sounds in your head. "*Did you need healing?*"

"*No, why?*" an unfamiliar voice replies.

"*Just checking,*" Yuuki replies, breaking off the call. She shrugs at you. "There you go, then."

"And she's the only independent in the city?" you ask.

"Yep," she says. "Unless someone popped up in the last day or so."

"Alright, then," you nod, exchanging a look with Mami. Sendai's lying. *Rin* was lying... Or herself misled. "Well. We don't particularly condone what the Sendai group is up to... But I want this entire thing *over*. It's not going to turn out well if it keeps escalating like it is. I... look. You guys have your issues with the Sendai group, I understand that. But if we can guarantee that they won't come after you, would you agree to help end this?"

"You... you've *dealt* with Hamasaki before, haven't you?" Yuuki asks, rolling her eyes. "You *can't* guarantee that. But yeah, I get what you're saying." She flaps a hand at you. "If you can actu-"

"*No,*" Aki grinds out. "I want to see her *dea-* No, actually, you know what. Fuck her shit. If she stops coming after us, I'm happy."

"Right," you nod. "So we're agreed, then?"

"If." Yuuki raises a finger. "It's a fairly big if. We've beaten the tar out of them before, and she still came back for another go. At this point, I really don't know why or what she expects, but she did. So..."

You nod again, conceding that. Silence falls for a moment.

"Y'know, I don't get you girls," Yuuki observes conversationally. "You in particular, Miss Sabrina. You come here, we, ah, attack you, you beat the hell out of us-" she gestures around at her group, prompting little cringes, "-and then you talk to us and then... you're done. Like, what the hell, girl?"

Mami answers for you. "That's because Sabrina wants to," she says, iron conviction in her tone and a warm, proud smile blossoming on her face as she glances at you. "She wants to *help*. And she *can*."

You redden in embarassment, but forge onwards. "And, uh. Not to... deliberately try and prove the point, but I've got one more thing to say... I can cleanse Soul Gems and Grief Seeds alike, and I'm willing to offer my services. Free of charge. *After* all this is over."

Looks of surprise, followed by darting glances at each other spread amongst the Ishinomaki girls. "Uh," Yuuki says, finally. "OK."

More awkward silence.

"*Hey,*" an unfamiliar voice sounds in your head, and you see Ayaka looking directly at you. The black haired girl gives you a serious look. "*You're staying with Mami, right?*" At your nod, she continues, "*Treat Mami properly, got that? I mean, I've... got my differences with her, but... I can see what you mean to her.*"

"*Yeah, I know,*" you reply. "*I know *damned* well.*"

"*Good,*" she says, seemingly satisfied.

Yuuki shakes her head. "So. Is there anything else, or may we leave?" she asks.

I was *wondering* whether anyone would pick up on the Setsuko thing before Mami. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

Also, whooo! Exams are done!

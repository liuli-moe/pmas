# Hazard Course Pt. 7

You can't help but sneak a look at Sayaka, but all you see is her cloak billowing dramatically upon an unfelt wind. Which, by the way, is *so* unfair. *You* don't get dramatically appropriate winds when there shouldn't be one. If *you* want dramatic billowing you've got to do it yourself.

*OK, you know what? Dibs on this one's Grief Seed, if you guys don't mind?* you say. \*Let's *not* bog the hunt down. I'll probably do a few tests on the go, but nothing major.

As long as you don't get distracted,\* Kyouko grumbles. She glares at you for a moment longer, a faceless silhouette, and then turns away and starts off at a light jog.

Yuma falls in at her side, bouncing along cheerfully, and Sayaka waves you on with a nod, scanning the featureless horizon. You shoot her a grateful grin - it's not that you're *not* going to watch for attacks, but having Sayaka watching your back gives you rather more peace of mind to study your wings.

And these *are* your wings, you're sure of that. Intangible, and... unfeathered, maybe - where Sayaka and Kyouko and Yuma and yourself are all silhouettes of colour, your wings are just *outlines*, a texture against the flat darkness of the Barrier. Even so, *they're your wings*. They move with you, attached to your shoulders, and you can flex them with as much ease as raising your hand or taking a breath, Sayaka swaying out of their way without breaking step as you extend your wings to their fullest extent.

Sorry, you mouth at her, but she just grins, waving it off.

*I'd definitely do the same if I found out I had wings,* she whispers to you. \*Or, you know, ghost wings. Whatever.

Well, still,\* you say. \*Thanks.

Sure, sure,\* Sayaka says, amused. *Now get on it, *angel*.*

The next thing you try is to try and fly. It doesn't work. Not the usual way you fly with your Grief wings, simply *willing* yourself upwards, nor with flapping. Flapping *emphatically* does not work, no matter how hard you flap or how stupid you look or how much Yuma stifles her giggling.

*Hey,* you say, clearing your throat pointedly over the giggling. \*Is it just me, or is it... really empty in here?

Not all Witches have Familiars,\* Kyouko grunts. \*Don't think this is one of 'em, though. They're waiting to ambush us.

Ah,\* you say, hefting your hammer a little tighter. Briefly, you consider making it one of those silly, cartoonishly large mauls, but quickly set that idea aside. You're... not entirely sure you'd wield it like that, truth be told - it doesn't feel *right*, even just thinking about it. You probably *could*, and you could probably figure out some special attacks with it much like Kyouko uses the giant form of her spear, but it'd be just that. A special attack, to be brought out for special occasions and specific uses.

You take advantage of the lack of combat to test your wings a little more. Namely, you leak some Grief into your wings from hammerspace, enough to fill them out to arm's length. And you watch in fascination as they blossom out in the same pure white as the rest of you.

Colour floods down the ghostly outlines of your wings and stops abruptly, exactly to the extent that you'd expected - just a little wider than your outstretched arms. They feel perfectly normal, too, to the touch and to your proprioception, moving and *touching* exactly as they should. And yet, beyond the monochrome white, the ghostly outlines of your *full* wings stretch against the darkness of the Barrier.

After a moment of prodding, you dismiss your wings fully, letting the Grief flow once more into hammerspace and leaving the outlines behind.

*It's quiet,* Sayaka says. Too\* quiet.

It's quiet because there's no sound!\* Yuma supplies helpfully.

*... yes, thank you, Yuma,* Sayaka says, pouting. \*Look, you can't pass up the opportunity to *say* that kind of thing, and it's not like Sabrina was taking the bait! Sabrina, back me up here.

It's true,\* you agree solemnly. *And-*

A premonition cuts you off with a frisson of *warning*, and all four of you leap upwards at the same time. Just in time for-

*-something-*

\-to pass through the spot you'd just been standing. And of course, you don't even have the time to land before something explodes on the ground beneath you, a flat, shuddering crack of sound and concussion set loose in the wake of whatever that was.

And then *another* detonation, and another, and another, rippling blasts of lightless, soundless explosions somehow managing to be bright and loud enough to hurt your ears, reverberating through the endless dark of the Barrier.

*Ah, fuck,* Kyouko grumbles tiredly as you all reach the individual apexes of your individual jumps and start to fall. *Hate this sort.*

You've never seen anything of this sort before, but you're inclined to agree as you descend towards the minefield. You *could* just flare your wings and fly over all the trouble, just as you could dissolve the Barrier, but really, this is Kyouko's hunt. So you'll do it her way, which is-

\-which is to take off running, her spear jabbing out at the darkness ahead of her. You can imagine her spear carving furrows in dirt that isn't there, slicing instead through utter darkness with crimson glowing at its tip. Yuma follows suit with a whoop, her mace drawn back over her shoulder as she shifts into a steady sprint.

Yeah, that figures. Aggression, in Kyouko's hands, honed to a razor's edge and shaped into the lynchpin to every strategy. It works for her, and judging by Sayaka's delighted grin as she follows, it works for her too. You snicker to yourself as you follow, hard on their heels.

And speaking of heels: the Familiars of this place are far more aggressive than those of the previous Witch, unseen monsters surfacing out of the darkness to snap at your feet. You get the impression of mandibles and lightless eyes, hard shells and scrabbling claws, looming out of the darkness to rattling cracks of the minefield.

The four of you meet them with magic and steel and ringing shouts, Kyouko and Yuma swapping off from minesweeping duty while you and Sayaka dash into the fray with swords and hammer carving grisly arcs through the Familiars.

*Animators *really* conserving the budget on this one,* you observe to Sayaka, swinging your hammer underarm into a pouncing Familiar and watching as it smears into more of the same invisible, unseeable black ichor, somehow stark against the unending darkness of the Barrier.

*And the voice acting budget!* Sayaka complains. \*I bet we're subbed right now or something. We better have a cool fight scene coming up.

Big sis, what are they-

Ignore them, Yuma, it might be infectious,\* Kyouko says. She suits action to word, jamming her spear into the ground and vaulting forward to bring her spear down axe-style into another Familiar.

*OK!* Yuma says cheerfully, waving at you before scampering on after her.

You focus on your hammer technique, as Kyouko instructed. It's a bit of a struggle to *not* send Grief slashing out in front of you, and to meet the Familiars with just your hammer. Even so, you manage to fall into the flow of combat, bouncing over a clawing sweep to smash the Familiar into the ground, twirling to hurl that same hammer at the next one, and ducking so that Sayaka's sword can hiss over your head to carve another Familiar in half.

Experimentally, you twist to lead with the outline of your wing against a Familiar - and when that fails to do anything, you finish the twirl by twisting into a chambered side-kick that launches the Familiar into one of Yuma's shockwaves.

The Witch, when you find it, is all but anticlimactic, little more than a dimly glowing orb hanging amidst the darkness. *Getting* there meant that you'd carved through an entire horde of Familiars amidst the constant explosions of the minefield, but now that you're here - the Witch doesn't even seem to be able to *attack*. Or at least, it raises no protest to your arrival.

Kyouko snorts, and puts her spear through the Witch.

Reality wavers around you with that familiar shiver in the air, depositing you out atop a forested hill. One of the nature-reserves-slash-parks within Mitakihara's borders, you think. You'll be able to tell when you get past the trees, anyway. Particularly sodden trees at that, fat, lazy droplets collected from the steady drizzle splashing down around you. And-

Yeah, your wings are definitely gone now. Back to being *fully* invisible and intangible now.

"*Hate* that sort of Barrier," Kyouko grumbles, then whirls on the spot, snatches the falling Grief Seed from the air, and tosses it at you in a single flowing motion, her costume fluttering around her. "There. Yours."

You barely manage to catch the Grief Seed aimed at your face, but catch it you do, and grin back.

"Thanks," you say.

Kyouko scowls and turns away, scanning the horizon - what she can see of it, anyway, what with all the trees in the way.

"Can't tell where we are, nothing in range," she grunts after a moment. "Let's get up to the rooftops."

You follow as Kyouko bounds up the trees, spear and the glow of magic lending her purchase enough to springboard much further into the air. The Grief Seed you slip into your pocket, reaching out for her name out of curiosity as you do so.

*Ichnaea*.

The name shivers in your mind as you launch yourself after Kyouko, the four of you soaring through the air in long, graceful leaps. If anyone's looking out of the windows of the highrise office buildings bordering the park, well... that's Kyuubey's problem.

"North-west!" Kyouko barks over the rush of wind and chill rain.

"No rest for the wicked!" you call back merrily, and redirect your path to follow her lead. You can *feel* Kyouko's eye-roll too, even though she refuses to look back at you.

And since you probably have a few moments to spare before you get to the next Witch...

"*Hey, Mami,*" you call warmly. "*How are you?*"

"*Sabrina!*" Mami's response is immediate, and bright and cheerful. "*Ah, I'm in biology class now, it's going alright. How are you? How's the hunt going?*"

"*Quite well!*" you say. And the smile probably shows on your face, judging by the way Sayaka squints back at you for a moment in between leaps, then smirks knowingly at you. "*Just cleared the second Witch, was a bit of an odd one, but both have been pretty smooth so far.*"

"*I'm glad!*" Mami says warmly. "*Are you alright, with the rain still going?*"

"*Yup, staying dry,*" you respond. "*Besides, a little rain wouldn't hurt anybody!*"

"*Still, do take care of yourself, Sabrina,*" Mami says.

"*I will. I promise,*" you say. "*How's bio class?*"

"*We're covering more about evolution today,*" Mami informs you. "*Ring species and intergradation - we're currently talking about the *Larus* genus of gulls.*"

"*Oh, yeah, one of the classic examples of evolution, yeah?*" you say.

"*Exactly so!*" Mami says, sounding amused. "*How did I know you'd know about them?*"

"*Because you know me?*" you say.

"*It's true, I do,*" Mami says.

"*Anyway, I suppose I should focus on the hunt, and *you* should focus on class,*" you say. "*See you at lunch, Mami.*"

"*Alright,*" Mami says. "*Stay safe.*"

You find yourself smiling goofily as you end the call. Talking to Mami never fails to lift your mood, really. Even so: you *should* focus on the hunt, since it's always a learning opportunity. If nothing else, on how *to* hunt Witches - Kyouko's far better at finding them than you are, even with your Grief sense.

"Speakin' of the wicked and all," Kyouko drawls a few moments later. "So, there's those couple of extra girls Mami's let into Mitakihara, and not just you."

"Miss Gaikotsu, Miss Wakahisa, and Miss Ono? They've actually been here for a while," you say, blinking. You... huh. You squint at the city whipping past, far below. "... and we're headed for their territory, if you weren't already aware."

"Mmmhm," Kyouko says, and OK, there's *got* to be a trick to that. You're all but shouting to be heard over the rain and the wind as you hurtle onwards across rooftops, and yet you can hear her just fine. Normally you'd just use telepathy.

"And the other two squatting over east, of course," Kyouko adds after another moment.

"Miss Watanabe and Miss Saito, yes," you say. "They *are* here on my invitation."

"Another two strays you'n Mami picked up, huh?" Kyouko asks, tilting her head just far enough to give you sidelong glare.

"They couldn't stay in Shiogama," you say mildly. "And it's not like they could up and move that easily."

"Uh-huh," Kyouko says. "Cool."

Her tone is completely even, not a hint of stress in her delivery - but well. Even *Yuma* looks askance at Kyouko's back, ahead of the group as she is. Sayaka catches your eye, exchanging a wary look with you.

Sayaka motions towards Kyouko, then herself, then you, and arches her eyebrow. Not a difficult message to decipher, but actually *answering* that message is a rather more difficult proposition.

*You or me?*

Apologies for the somewhat shorter chapter after the wait, but ahem. It's not like I could break at a later point than this, really. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# Unforeseen Consequences pt. 2

It takes you a moment to decide on your Wish, what you are willing to sell your soul for. Things like being able to control Witches, summoning unspeakable horrors from beyond the veil of reality, and so forth flash across your mind, before you settle on one. Despite your slumped over position against the wall, you lean forward, staring at Kyuubey. "I wish to control grief! My own! That of others! The grief of the Witches! All of it!"

Twinned sharp inhales from the two girls by your side, and the beginnings of a confused, "Wha-"

"I see," the Incubator says, without inflection. Its eyes begin to glow, becoming little novas of light, and it stretches its ear appendages towards, *into* you. Dimly, you can hear Madoka and Sayaka, watching on in awe, gasp.

"Contract successful. Your soul has successfully reduced entropy."

A wave of pain explodes outwards from your chest, suffusing every fiber of your being. Your jaw clenches to bite back a scream, as Kyuubey slowly withdraws a brilliantly shining white gem that floats aloft before you. Without prompting, you reach out with one hand and grasp it, clutching it tightly to yourself.

A deep breath.

And again.

Your free hand reaches out, and you flex it, the lack of *pain* that had been a constant since you awoke is an almost euphoric drug in and of itself. A smile comes to your face unbidden, and you rise smoothly to your feet, feeling better than you have for as long as you can remember. Not that that's terribly long, of course.

The two girls, after a moment of hesitation, stand, too. Madoka smiles at you, but her smile is now tinged with a little worry, and what you think is trepidation. Sayaka's frowning at you, still suspicious and still wary of you. Kyuubey winds through their feet like the cat that it imitates, tail lashing furiously.

Do you want to be mysterious know-it-all? Do you want to be the cheerful, unflappable authority figure? Do you want to be the renegade bitch? Or someone else? None of these are binding for the future, just how do you want to present yourself to the girls right now\.No, there's no real significance to the examples. They're just examples.

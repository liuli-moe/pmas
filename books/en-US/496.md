# On a Rail pt. 13

"Another round after a short rest?" you say, smiling around at your friends. "Also, dibs on Mami!"

Mami makes a pleased little noise and nestles into the hug. Homura, by contrast, snorts softly, eyeing Sayaka.

"Sounds good!" Sayaka agrees, smirking at you. She doesn't seem to have picked up on Homura's snort. She pauses, plucking at a splash of yellow on her skirt. "Uh..."

Mami snaps her fingers, and the clinging bits of ribbon melt away from both you and Sayaka.

You unlatch from Mami, twisting from side to side to work out some kinks from your back. "Also, I'm thinking that after this, we do one more match with Homura and I against Mami and Sayaka? That way we'll have tried every possible combination."

Homura nods in agreement, eyeing you for a moment, then Sayaka.

Speaking of whom... You walk over to Sayaka, offering her a grin and a hand. "Oh, and before we do anything else... Thank you, Sayaka," you say. "For being such a good teammate. Excellent teamwork and communication, and you set up some nice attacks, too."

"Thanks!" Sayaka says, face lighting up with a smile as she takes your hand. "You too."

"So..." you turn to Mami and Homura with a grin. "Our dear sempais, how *did* we do?"

Mami straightens, taking a breath. The effort to try and look serious is somewhat ruined by the pleased smile on her face, though. "I agree with your assessment, Sabrina," she says, nodding at you. "You and Sayaka worked well together. Though... You were both too reckless."

You nod. "I took a few shots I should have been able to avoid, a little too greedy in trying to close. In my defense, I was also trying to learn to do that..." You purse your lips. "You know how you're almost prescient in combat, Mami? I've seen you make shots before the target was even in sight. I was trying to learn that."

"Can't you sense us all, Sabrina?" Mami asks. "You don't need to *predict* when you can do that."

"Sure, but I have a range limit on my sensing," you say. "I might get sniped from outside that."

Mami, and perhaps not so surprisingly, Homura both nod. "That makes sense," Mami agrees slowly. "Still, if we're all together..."

You flash her a smile. "Yeah. It works best if you're around to cover my back."

Mami returns the smile, and turns to Sayaka. "Sayaka, you were too dependent on the shield," she says. "You shouldn't be trying to block the shots - in other circumstances, I could have used something bigger."

Loud, mechanical clacks draw your attention away, to Homura, who-

To Homura, who-

Well, of *course* she has a Barret. An M82 sniper rifle, to be precise, probably one of *the* most iconic sniper rifles in the world. Of course. The JSDF *does* use them, of course. Their special forces, at any rate. She effortlessly balances one-point-four meters of sleek, matte black steel and plastic on her hip, managing to look smug without changing her expression a single iota.

"... or that?" Sayaka manages weakly.

"... or something like that," Mami agrees. "The shield is an excellent supplement to your defense, Sayaka, but it shouldn't be the *entirety* of your defense, unless it can do something more than simply block."

Homura nods, and makes the rifle vanish.

Sayaka bites her lip, frowning in thought. "I..." she motions at Homura. "I'm not sure that gun could have gone through the shield, actually. It... feels like it's proof against something like that."

"I don't have to shoot the *shield*," Homura says in a cool, even tone. "If I hit you in the arm..." She trails off, giving Sayaka a meaningful look.

... Sayaka and limb loss. Heh.

"Point taken," Sayaka says, going a tad green.

"Actually, Homura," you say, waving your hand to get their attention. "You have a shield, too. Any tips to give?"

Homura glances down at her tiny buckler. "Different kinds of shield," she points out, raising it in front of her. "Mine facilitates my magic." A flare of purple light swirls around her, outlining the shape of a half dome.

"Huh, cool," Sayaka says, squinting at the shield.

"You're too stationary," Homura continues, as if she hadn't been interrupted. You barely note her hand's movement before she flickers, and-

The air shatters under the sound of a half dozen shots cleaving through the air, bracketing Sayaka. They hammer past her, bullets crashing into the car behind her.

The bleunette's eyes go wide and shocked.

"If you don't keep moving, it becomes easy to set up attacks," Homura continues, raising her hand to her hair. She hooks her fingers through the lustrous black strands, sending them flowing outwards like a midnight dark waterfall with a single, effortless flick of her hand that draws the eye to the silky-

You wrench your gaze away, sidling over to Mami instead. Madokami *damn* Homura's hair. Then again, Madokami would probably be the *last* goddess to damn Homura's hair.

Sayaka makes a strangled noise.

Mami frowns, shaking her head. "That was too harsh, Homura," she says. She softens as you bump against her side, leaning her shoulder against yours.

Homura shrugs. "Lessons tend to be," she says.

Sayaka rolls her eyes. "I get it. Really I do. You could have just *told* me, Homura." She glances at her shield, shaking it thoughtfully.

Homura shrugs again.

"Anyway..." you say, taking a half step forward. "Mami, I've been meaning to ask-" You indicate Sayaka with a hand. "Magical weapons and outfits and so on, right? If we want to change or make stuff, is it just a matter of willpower, or...?"

Mami smiles. "Usually, yes," she says. "You simply have to visualise what you need, in my experience. Within reason. There are certain limitations that can only be overcome by experimentation, and sometimes there are hard limits and, ah, mental blocks. But enough time and experience..." She motions at Homura, who nods.

"Hm," you say. "I've noticed that I can reshape my outfit with a bit of concentration, and obviously Sayaka has her shield. By the way, seat, everyone? While we discuss?" Your spare a moment of thought to shape Grief into some simple benches for everyone.

"Right!" Mami agrees, smiling. She checks the bench behind her and sits, patting the seat behind her and glancing at you. "However, I've found that the further you deviate from the, ah, existing theme, the less... instinctual it becomes to use."

"So my sword can shoot its blade, but I shouldn't try and make... I dunno, a grenade launcher?" Sayaka says, giving her sword a speculative look. She plunks herself down on the bench, kicking out her feet.

"Right," Mami agrees, leaning against your side as you sit beside her. "You're lucky, because you have a ranged and a melee option to expand on."

"Hmm... So I probably don't have a ranged option," you say, summoning a fresh hammer and laying it across your lap to inspect closely. It's just solid forged metal, gleaming and elaborately engraved. You absently trace a few of the lines with a finger.

Mami bites her lip. "Maybe you do?" she says, expression falling. "It's not impossible! But you might have a harder time learning to use it, that's all-"

You laugh. "It's alright, Mami," you say. "It's what I have my Grief for, and it's what I have you and Homura and Sayaka for, right?"

Sayaka grins at you. "Damn straight."

Mami colours a little, but manages to smile.

"Hey, on the up side," you say, pointing a finger gun at Sayaka. "You could probably stab your blade into something and then make it explode. Would be useful against bigger Witches, I imagine."

Sayaka frowns. "Hmm... you're probably right," she says, eyeing her sword.

"Most likely," Homura agrees, violet eyes meeting yours for a moment before glancing at Sayaka.

"Hng," Sayaka says. "Thanks for the vote of confidence. Proooobably not gonna test it in a spar, though."

"Yeah," you agree. "That's probably a good idea."

"Probably," Mami agrees, tone laced heavily with irony. "I think we can start on the next spar now that everyone's rested up a bit?"

Sayaka kicks her legs out and bounces to her feet. "I'm good for it!"

Homura rises, too, eyeing Sayaka.

"I'm good," you agree. "If there's nothing else that I need to pay attention to before the next round? Oh, and cleansing, of course."

Mami shakes her head. "No," she says, smiling at you. "That's it."

You rub your hands together, dissolving the benches and raising a hand. "Gems, everyone, for cleansing!"

With that done, you and Mami pull back a few steps. "*I'll try and ambush Sayaka a few times,*" you murmur to Mami.

She nods. "*Good idea,*" she says, throwing a look over her shoulder at Sayaka and Homura. "*Let me know, and I'll distract Homura when you're doing that.*"

"*Gotcha,*" you say. "*I'm going to keep trying to learn that prescience trick, if you think that's OK?*"

"*Go ahead,*" she responds. "*Though... I have to admit, it took me a very long time to learn it, myself.*"

"*Fair enough,*" you respond. "*Start the match?*"

Mami smiles, and does just that. You give her one last fleeting grin, and then you're both focusing on the spar. You go after Sayaka - there's no point in fighting Homura when your particular weakness is *melee*.

The thunder of Mami's muskets and the soft chatter of Homura's airsoft guns is the backdrop as you clash with Sayaka. The first time, she doesn't notice you coming. A quick word to Mami as you close in, and her attempt at Mami's back is neatly ended by two bracketing shots from Mami and a tackle from you. You get in a neat, pulled strike at her head before backing off.

Of course, in melee, without the element of surprise, you're rather hard pressed, especially when Homura manages to spare a couple of shots to help Sayaka. Every swing of Sayaka's swords drives you back, until you finally disengage and go airborne.

You take the opportunity to coordinate with Mami and divebomb Homura. A fusillade of shots pins the time traveller in place for a moment just as you swoop from above to tag her.

Your next clash isn't nearly as swift - the surprise has Sayaka on the back foot for a second, but she keeps you grounded and manages to drive you away from Mami's supporting fire. Despite your training, you're still not terribly good at melee, and you end that clash with Sayaka's blade menacing your face. And then Mami's on top of you, and you're both charging at Homura in smooth tandem.

And so it goes. This time, you and Mami manage a win, by a bare point. Mostly through Mami's efforts, really. After a short rest, you start in on the final match for now, with the remaining matchup.

You turn your grin on Mami and Sayaka. "Last match," you say. "Let's have a good one."

Mami beams at you, watching as you and Homura back off.

This time, Sayaka manages to ambush *you.* Well, not so much an ambush as Mami raining down shots that sizzle past you while Sayaka leaps from behind a stack of old cars. You *knew* she was there, but she still manages to get to you, and then she's raining a flurry of chops and slashes on you.

Sayaka stays on you. Homura's only able to spare so much help - and Mami keeps her busy. No matter how you juke or disengage, Sayaka's on your tail in seconds. Even hooking her leg from under her and tackling her to the ground -you'll take that as a point, thank you very much- doesn't buy you much breathing room. She's on her feet in seconds and following you into the air in a burst of cerulean light.

The spar draws to a close with you being threatened once more by Sayaka's sword to your jugular. She drops the sword at Mami's call, stepping back and stretching.

"Good one!" she says happily.

You snort. "Sure, I got harassed halfway across Japan by you."

She shrugs, holding her hand out to you. "Hey, it's, uh, melee training for you, right?"

You roll your eyes, but you shake her hand. "How about you, Mami, Homura?"

"It was a good match," Mami agrees, offering her hand to Homura.

The time traveller doesn't hesitate, taking the proffered hand and shaking it firmly. "Good match."

You flop onto a flash-formed Grief bench, shaping ones for everyone. "Mnrghl," you grumble, stretching out. You're not *tired*, precisely. You're not sure you really *get* tired any more. Or at least, not very easily. Nevertheless, you feel the exertion, somehow, just enough feedback to know that you *have* been using your muscles.

Mami sits next to you and leans against you with a happy sigh.

Sayaka flops on a bench, and Homura sits primly on her own.

"Anyway," you say. "Sparring match aside, there's a few things I wanna bring up. First - Mami and I are heading out of town for a bit tomorrow to talk to a few groups of magical girls."

"Ishinomaki?" Homura asks, eyes sharp.

"Ishinomaki, Sendai, maybe Tokyo? What's-her-name-Ueda was supposed to get back to us, but she hasn't yet. Or was I supposed to get back to her? I think she was supposed to get back to me," you say, running your fingers through your hair. "But yeah. Sayaka, if you want, you could come along - I can check if they'd let you practice your power."

Sayaka scratches her head. "That sounds... cool. How long would you be headed out?"

Spoiler: Winning vote

- [x] Back to Mitakihara
  - [x] Invite Yuki along to claim a random building
    - [x] Warehouse-kun!
  - [x] Do not invite Yuki along for lunch. We'll see her later

"Then let's go," you say, beaming.

You feel *lighter* as Mami stands gracefully and twirls to offer you a hand up, the weight of that penultimate secret lifted from your shoulders and replaced with the comfort of knowing, *knowing* that Mami has your back. Fully, and wholeheartedly.

You let the privacy construct unravel - you'd considered hanging on to it just in case, but you have enough enchanted Grief to make another if you need to, so there's no real point. And you find yourself smiling goofily at Mami, holding her hand still as reality floods back in, the low hum and groans of a living building and a city beyond filling your ears once more.

"Oh, done talkin'?" Kirika cracks open the teddy-bear-print door, one citrine eye and a segment of her fanged grin visible in the gap. "The sulky girl and her daughter's back."

"Never call Yuma that in front of Kyouko," you say. "... and don't call Kyouko that either, if you value your kneecaps."

"Eh, I can take her," Kirika says. "She's too wound up in her own head to fight properly. But c'mon, everyone's gone up to the roof already."

You give Kirika a dubious look. She's probably right about Kyouko being too stuck in her own head, and Kirika might be a monster in melee, but *so is Kyouko*. And Kyouko's experienced in a way most magical girls aren't, having carved herself a life alone with nothing but her spear and sheer, bloody-minded force of will.

Mami chuckles softly as Kirika grins and bounces away.

"Shall we?" she says.

"Yeah," you say. "Time to head back home."

Mami's smile widens, and she goes up on her toes to press a kiss to your cheek. And without giving you a moment to recover, she takes your hand and tugs you out of the room, heading for the stairs. Her grin, glimpsed in little glances back, does little to quell the helpless delight driving your own giggles.

As you step out onto the roof, squinting against the midday sun even as a pleasantly cool breeze winds its way past you, ruffling your coat. You find, as promised, everyone gathered on the roof - Kirika draped over Oriko, Kyouko slouched against the wall of the stairwell with Yuma beside her, both sharing a bag of chips. And Kazumi's perched on top of a humming air conditioner vent, conversing with Yuki and taking advantage of the additional height to keep Niko from escaping with one hand stroking through her hair.

Kyouko flicks a glance over to you, then away.

Niko's sleepy, lazily satisfied eyes settle upon you as the stairwell door swings shut behind you and she brightens, murmuring something to Kazumi, who pats her hair one more time before allowing the blonde to duck away from her hand to march over.

"So, the Gems," she says briskly, combing her hands through her hair. "I've got a good idea of what needs to be done now, and scratch the thing about *maybe* needing a strong healer. I need one, or you're getting a revive rate of about one girl every two weeks, and that's *if* I can dedicate all my time to it. *And* I'd need a Clear Seed to dedicate to the girl being revived if I'm doing it manually."

"Strong healer, got it," you say, nodding. "I'll find us one, then."

"Cool," Niko says, and props her fists on her hips. "Don't keep me waiting for too long, I want to see how this works."

"Will do," you say. "And, uh, I really didn't expect you to be able to figure it out this quickly."

"Oh, I haven't," Niko says airily. "I'll still need a couple days. I've got a good idea of the actual mechanics involved, but I need to actually confirm it all."

"... ah. That makes more sense," you say. "OK! Let me know if you hit any snags or anything, I'll be happy to hop on over. And on that note, uh... Miss Tsuruya? Am I interrupting?"

"Not at all," Yuki says, looking up. "We were just discussing a potential visit later; I would like to speak further with Miss Wakaba."

"Huh," you say. Right, yeah, they've got that whole probably-playful rivalry going, with Mirai having allowed Yuki to lay a claim to the teddy bear museum that is their home. "Well, if you're sure-" You wait for Yuki to nod before continuing. "-then I just wanted to double-check that you're good to come over to Mitakihara to lay a temporary claim on a building, right? I've got a place in mind - it's not exactly a home, but it'll do until Homura and Hitomi can get the house?"

"I was under the impression that Miss Shizuki would be expediting the process so I could claim the house this evening," Yuki says, frowning lightly. "A matter of crossed purposes, I suppose. But I have no objection - I'll simply take a lighter hold, and it would save us a trip later this evening."

"Great," you say. "In that case, Miss Kanna-"

"Oh, come on, Niko-san will do," Niko interjects.

"Right, yeah - if you hit any snags or whatever, let me know," you say. "I'll be happy to come over, and if Miss Tsuruya's willing to lend her aid, it won't be a problem."

"Cool!" Niko says. "See ya around, then!"

And with that last bit of discussion done, you exchange goodbyes with everyone- "Umika says bye and thanks but she's going to be screaming into her pillow for a bit" -and then you're abruptly in Fukushima, courtesy of Yuki's magic. And with a tiny effort of will, you get everyone airborne, cradled safely within the confines of your flight disc and soaring into the clear blue sky with the sun beating down from above.

Mami snuggles happily into your side, Oriko and Kirika behind you, and Kyouko seated in the back as Yuma hangs over the edge, taking in the view and the rush of the wind. Yuki asked for a seat in the rear but seems little interested in actually sitting down for the moment, joining Yuma in enjoying the blurring landscape and roaring winds, albeit with considerably more dignity.

"*So, Mami-sempai, Sabrina,*" Kazumi's voice speaks into your mind as the sprawl of Fukushima gives way to the rolling checkboards of fields. "*I spoke to Kyouko, and I promised I wouldn't tell you what we talked about.*"

"*I did expect as much,*" Mami says. She doesn't stir, perfectly comfortable with your cheek leaned against the crown of your head, but you can feel the wave of tension thrumming through her body.

"*She's hurting,*" Kazumi says bluntly. "*There's things that past me and current her share in common, Mami. And it's been a long time for her, you know?*"

"*It has been,*" Mami agrees gravely. "*But I don't know what to do about it, either.*"

"*I don't know either, her situation... isn't the same as mine,*" Kazumi says. "*I helped her where I could, and I think I did get through to her a bit, but she's been stewing on this for a *while*. So I thought you should know, if you didn't already.*"

"*Thank you,*" Mami says. "*We had an idea, but the reminder was definitely welcome. We'll work on it.*"

"*That's all I wanted!*" Kazumi says, cheer returning. "*I'll see you later\~*"

You sigh lightly as Kazumi breaks the mental connection, leaving the two of you in a contemplative silence.

It's not like Kyouko hasn't been on your thoughts, what with her circling resentment and that mysterious request to go talk to Kazumi. She's been doing better, you think, and trying to reach out more, but you're... worried. You're worried that you're just not the right person to help Kyouko, for many reasons.

Because *you* are Mami's replacement for Kyouko, in her eyes. And that's not *true* in anything more than the superficial sense, because you can't replace people like that. Kyouko herself should know - Yuma isn't a replacement for Momo. She might have picked Yuma up because she *reminded* her of Momo, but Yuma's her own person, and you're certain Kyouko knows that.

And you're pretty sure, at this point, that Kyouko has a crush on Mami. To your surprise, the though doesn't leave you particularly jealous - rather, it leaves you *worried*. Because that on top of everything else Kyouko's feeling only leaves her issues more complicated. The mix of guilt and awful self-esteem and potentially romantic feelings and *everything else* is a volatile mix.

"*... we're... going to have to talk about Kyouko, later,*" you murmur to Mami.

"*We are,*" she agrees, her mental voice soft but warm, even with the worry underlying her tone.

"*We'll figure out how to tackle it,*" you promise. "*And we'll do it together, just like everything else. Kyouko's your friend -*our* friend- and she's worth that.*"

"*I know,*" Mami says, but even so, that tension ebbs.

The rain's finally let up fully by the time you make it back to Mitakihara, the sullen clouds having finally broken up at some point since you left, and the city practically sparkles beneath the midday sun as you cruise in to drop off Oriko and Kirika at their mansion. Oriko offers you a contented smile and a stately nod as she takes Kirika's hand, stepping off the flight platform.

You return the nod, remembering her pronouncement even as you all exchange goodbyes. She wants to *live*, and you're going to do everything you can to make sure she does. They deserve their happy ending, too.

"Kyouko, Yuma, d'you want me to drop you off somewhere?" you ask as the Kures wave you off. "You're welcome to come along if you want, of course."

Kyouko grunts.

"Drop us off at the mall," she says, then adds, grudgingly, "Please."

"Sure," you say, smiling.

And so you drop Kyouko and Yuma off, Yuma giving you a big smile as she waves enthusiastically enough to make her hair bounce. The platform you shrink down, since it's just you, Mami, and Yuki now, the latter taking in Mitakihara with a practiced, interested eye as you glide past.

"Mitakihara is a beautiful city," she notes.

"It's home," Mami says, smiling.

Yuki laughs softly.

"I suppose that's all we can ask for," she says.

You soar out westwards, swinging past the bustling, glittering heart of Mitakihara's central business district, past the towering spire of the DBJ building and onwards to the old industrial district. Soon, you're descending towards a familiar, battered old warehouse, surrounded by that same rusting chainlink fence.

"... oh, this must be Warehouse-kun," Mami says, smiling as she accepts your hand to step off the flight platform, her shoes scraping on the sandy floor. She cranes her head back, taking in the dilapidated old building, and smiles.

"Sayaka told you, didn't she?" you grumble.

"No comment!" Mami says brightly.

Yuki huffs out an amused laugh as she hops down behind Mami, her cloak fluttering and settling about her.

"Old and abandoned," she observes, padding over to the main door and looking around. "The walls are rusting, and so is the roof. No furniture, of course, or even a proper floor inside... but it's whole. A leak or two in the roof, a draft through the doors." She smiles. "It'll do."

Gently, she nudges the doors shut, the hinges groaning, before placing her hands against both halves and closing her eyes.

Her magic is a slow, tectonic thing, spreading like the slow seep of magma across the ground. Grinding and warm and longing and ponderous, the steady bedrock of looking forward to going *home* at the end of the day. Comforting and somehow achingly yearning, pouring through the doors and suffusing the entire building. There's no grand crescendo or blaze or light, simply a sense of completion, of *satisfaction* as her claim fills the warehouse.

Yuki takes a breath, and opens her eyes, smiling distantly.

"If we wish to keep using this location for much longer, we should so some maintenance. Patch up the ceilings, perhaps re-do the floor and bring in some furniture," she says. "But for now, this will suffice."

"Thank you, Miss Tsuruya," you say, smiling. "Hopefully we'll have news for you this evening."

"Indeed," Yuki says with a measured nod. "I'll see you later, then."

"Until next time!" Mami says.

You watch as Yuki steps forward into Warehouse-kun... and simply vanishes between one step and the other, a rush of magic and the faintest puff of cooler air all there is to mark her vanishing from Mitakihara.

You laugh abruptly.

"I can't say I expected Miss Tsuruya to be quite this gung-ho about our alliance, about Constellation," you say. "But here we are. I'm honestly glad I invited her to it, really."

"I would say that she always seemed the ambitious sort, but *lacked* a good way to truly expend that ambitiousness. Mercenary work can only go so far, with magical girls being what they are," Mami says, squeezing your arm lightly and smiling at you. "They were surviving, but not more than that. But you, Miss Vee, gave her an outlet and a goal for that ambition, not to mention the surety of a Clear Seed. Why *wouldn't* she be enthusiastic about it? Also."

Mami gives you an amused grin.

"Wasn't *she* the one to propose it?" she asks.

"... well, you know what I mean," you say, beaming at Mami. Struck by a sudden impulse, you lean down to press a kiss to her cheek, then straighten up again. "Now, we've made good time so we'll be a little early, but shall we head to lunch?"

"We shall!" Mami says happily.

Also, I basically never do this, but I'm going to endorse [this](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/page-7656#post-30980468) analysis here as being *quite* accurate to Kyouko in PMAS. It's about time Sabrina got a clue about Kyouko, really. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

Also, yes, I'm going to lock in the Soujus as a discussion topic - mainly because Sayaka's [reaction](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/page-7442#post-28088018) to the sheer *violence* was something Madoka and Hitomi (and Homura) both witnessed, plus, Mami rushing out of class as she did would be school gossip, so it's kind of inevitable. You can write in any specific approach for the topic if you want to hit some specific notes, of course.

# Power Up Pt. 18

Your thoughts keep getting stuck on the whole 'elder cousin' thing. Well, rather, you keep getting stuck on the damned near *instinctive* impulse to deny any such *respectability*, countering with the fact that you're only three weeks old. People looking up to you, *ew*.

Well, granted, you're also stuck on trying to disentangle what Akane actually *means* by that, and all the strangeness associated with her. Or rather - the surface reading is pretty clear, you suppose. She thinks you're the same sort of entity that *she* is, but the problem is that you're not sure what *she* is, nor if she's actually right. Nor the fact that she thinks you're her senior.

*Could* you be?

Not temporally, considering that the Tokyo Council's been around for much longer than your paltry three weeks, but... well, you're Wishborn in some way, and at that, you're Wishborn from *Madoka's* Wish in a universe that was unhappened. There's no way Akane can know that, though, but then she *has* that whole strings-of-fate motif tied to her. Maybe she *can* sense that.

Hah, *tied* to her.

Anyway. You can't exactly have people thinking you're *respectable*. That just won't do. And more seriously, it's the kind of misunderstanding you don't want to allow to stand - it could be dangerous. *Assumptions* are dangerous, and it behooves you to clear that up, even if it means losing credibility. Credibility you don't deserve, in this case.

You take a moment to relay those thoughts to Madoka and Hitomi, and current events, back home in Mitakihara. Not the born-of-Madoka's-Wish thing, of course.

"*Thats- that's, um!*" Madoka says, the anxiety radiating across the telepathic voice call. "*Yes, clarifying is good!*"

"*It *could* be an advantage, to be acknowledged as an elder,*" Hitomi says clinically. "*But not if it's a role you're uncertain how exactly you fit in. Honesty is definitely the best policy here. And besides, I'm interested in her response.*"

"*Noted,*" you say. "*I'll call you again in a few minutes, but sit tight for now, OK? Toshimichi's working on undoing the freeze, or whatever it is, so everyone should be OK soon.*"

"I..." You cut yourself off, glancing at Akane's expression of strain and concentration, and the way her fingers twitch next to each other as if playing cat's cradle with invisible strings. "Sorry, do you need to concentrate?"

"Not so much that I am unable to listen," Akane says, turning a curious look on you - albeit, a curious look framed by furrowed brows and the sweat beading upon her forehead. Akari gives her a look of equivalent concern, but doesn't say anything.

"Well... I'm not sure I *am* much of an elder cousin," you admit, perhaps a touch sheepishly. "I woke up three weeks ago in an alleyway with no, ah, personal memories, but a lot of... *raw* knowledge, as it were. And I just wanted to get that across, and make sure that there's no misunderstandings?"

"Pah, as if temporal age has anything to do with anything," Akane says, surprisingly forcefully for someone with eyes squeezed shut once more and face screwed up in deep concentration. "You might be younger than me in linear experience, but even as young as I am, I can sense the fates that cling to you. You wear it well, and I might not have noticed had you not made it so obvious. A moment, please."

"Right." You fall silent, because you can feel it - the surge of magic around Akane even as she herself freezes into immobility. Megu groans, the silvery structure of the shared magic between herself and Akane twisting as if burning in an invisible bonfire. The threads of her magic unwind from each other with the ponderous momentum of a glacier, some lifting off of each other and unpeeling from the main skein surrounding her, sloughing from the tight weft to drift free once more.

The world almost seems to shiver as the threads fall clear of your friends, and they seem to snap from their frozen positions into motion once more, like a video skipping frames.

"Wh-" Sayaka clutches at her forehead. "*Ow.*"

"Sabrina?" Mami staggers from her half-ready stance, her voice tinged by confusion and echoed by similar murmurs from the others. You can feel Mika's winds tug at your clothes as they draw around her, and a near-imperceptible deepening of the shadows at your feet from Moe.

"Stop!" you call, whirling on your friends and gesturing frantically for them to, well, stop. There's probably some irony in using that particular word right now, really, but you're rather too preoccupied to investigate *that* train of thought. "Stop, stop, everyone *stop* what you're doing, we're not under attack right now, we're fine."

You stare down the tableau with an expression on your face that's probably only a *little* panicked, taking them all in. Ten pairs of eyes are on you - but that's *good*, because that means everyone's listening to you. Mami relaxing from her battle-ready stance, tense and alert but relaxing *anyway* because she *trusts* you, the soft gold of her gaze steady on yours. Sayaka, squinting at you through a gap in gloved hands - backlash from the clone and Akane's whole... thing, you presume, and something to be addressed in a moment.

Mika, a light, amused smile returning to her face as she considers you, but she doesn't exactly *relax*. Not with the way the winds curl around her robes and ruffle her hair. But she's not attacking, just *ready*, her attention shifting from you to the Chiyoda girls with a thoughtful air. Kazumi and Umika are both glancing between you and Mami, and the frozen auditorium at your back. Their tension bleeds away as they see Mami relaxing, while Niko stares at Akane with undisguised fascination, her gaze flickering between Akane, Megu, and the... spell structure connecting the two of them.

Shinobu and Moe are perhaps the most wary still, shadows licking over Moe's arms like dark flames and Shinobu with her fists clenched and shoulders taut, eyes darting all over as she scans for a threat. But they're not attacking either, and that's *enough*.

And the Chiyoda girls, still on their dais behind your group of friends.

Akane stares at you, perfectly composed once more with her hands clasped in her lap and the train of her gown settled about her like a... rug. There's presumably a better simile, but when it has the approximate area of a small room and is spread out perfectly flat along the floor, you're happy to call it a rug, albeit one attached to a person *but you digress*. Akane stares at you with no trace of awareness of the derailed train of thought in your mind, observing with calm distinctly at odds with her earlier strain.

To Akane's right sits Megu, and kneeling at her side are Aoi and Akari, an unlikely-looking duo in labcoat-chic and iridescent blue armour, both watching the blonde carefully. You understand *that*, at least, with the way she'd borne the strain for Toshimichi trying to restrain *you*, concern is *entirely* warranted. Megu herself is still pale and pinched, as if she'd just run a marathon of marathons, and has a fresh Grief Seed to her Soul Gem, siphoning out the last dregs of what must have been a *painful* amount of Grief - and that *after* you'd ripped away enough to have Witched out a magical girl with a lesser capacity.

That... latter bit seems to have been your fault, at least partially. Akane had tried to snare *you* in the effect, and it had gone... poorly. You're not entirely sure why, either.

"There are certain secrets of magic that are... dangerous," Akane says, looking around with a measured eye. "As I am certain you are all aware. Imai Taeko of Meiji is one of the unlucky few who happens to have discovered one of those secrets, and it has been one of the causes for her group's dissatisfaction. She attempted to trumpet this secret, at which point I pre-empted Miss Vee's actions. Better that I, a known factor, take action rather than an outsider. I apologise for any distress that I have caused."

"Oh, is that all?" Mika says lightly, releasing the winds around her and tucking her hands back into her sleeves. There's still a certain tension to her posture, if not her magic. "That makes sense."

"Sabrina?" Mami murmurs quietly to you.

You nod, shooting Mami a quick, strained smile.

"I can corroborate that," you say. "I was about to shroud all of us with Grief just in case Imai *did*, uh, say what she was going to say. That said, Miss Toshimichi? We're at least aware that the infohazard *exists*, but some have chosen to not know for the moment."

"What, exactly, did you do?" Shinobu asks, propping a fist against her hip.

"I spoke truth, and ceased your flows of karma temporarily," Akane says, raising her chin. "It should have been harmless, but I did not account for your nature, Miss Miki, nor yours, Miss Vee. I apologise."

Shinobu's eyebrows go *right* up to her hairline.

"'xplains the stabbing pain," Sayaka mumbles, rubbing her eye. She catches your concerned look and adds, "It's going away."

"And you were going to... what, stop us in place and shut Imai over there up?" Moe says. She's lowered her arms to her sides, but the usual pep of her voice is gone, now flat and stony. Her gaze flickers over to you for a moment.

"Essentially correct. I would have undone the occurrence," Akane says. "Understand that it is not something that I do lightly - as tempting as it is sometimes, simply commanding that she *forget* is something that sits ill with us."

"Are you saying that you would have... what, ctrl-Zed the universe?" Kazumi says.

"I'm... not sure I follow the exact analogy?" Akane says, tilting her head. "But it would have been localized."

"Bulls-" Niko's protest is cut off by Umika slapping her hand over the shorter girl's mouth, the blonde nearly vibrating in place with indignation.

"*Niko,*" Umika hisses, turning to Akane without removing the hand clamped over Niko's mouth. "I apologise for my teammate, Miss Toshimichi. She's always been one to, ah, cut to the chase, especially when the chase is in pursuit of novel magic."

"I take no offense," Akane says. "I've certainly faced more than my fair share of disbelief, but then, the impossible often does, does it not, Miss Vee?"

"True enough," you concede, eyeing her. The flow of karma, true speech, the Three Treasures... she *certainly* has everything to play the part of a *kami*, or at least one divinely blessed. You're not surprised that people accept her claims of being a descendant of the royal line.

"Nik- *yeurgh*!" Umika yanks her hand back just in time for you to see Niko close her mouth, looking smug.

"*Ahem*," Niko says pointedly, grabbing Umika's hand and hauling it above her head in a bizarre parody of a waltz, preventing her from wiping said hand. She continues speaking over Umika's flailing. "May I ask a few questions, Toshimichi-sama?"

"There are questions I cannot answer, and questions that I will not answer," Akane says, unperturbed by the scuffling. "But certainly - I am not as easily offended as you might imagine."

"Er, if I may interject?" you say, raising your hand. "I have a technique, one I've shared with Kazumi, that allows me to raise a field of absolute privacy? It's totally impenetrable, as far as I know, and if it changes the calculus of the discussion, I'm willing to arrange for it?"

"Mine'll be faster!" Kazumi volunteers happily, moving to pull Niko off Umika and restrain her with a hug.

"No," Akane says, shaking her head. "What I say to one, I will say to all of you, or not at all."

"Information can be dangerous," Aoi says sharply, rising to her feet. She's finished fussing over Megu, it seems, having wiped the... healer's? face down with a wet cloth. Aoi tosses the soft lavender of her braid over her shoulder and faces you all down, fists balled. "We have carved ourselves a bit of *stability* here with blood and sweat and *our very souls*, do you understand?"

"Peace, Aoi," Akane says, motioning for Aoi to stand down. "I don't mind the asking." She glances at the frozen auditorium -the frozen *Tokyo Council*- that forms the backdrop to your conversation. "We do not have any particular need for urgency, after all."

Kazumi, still restraining Niko by virtue of cuddling her into submission, flicks a questioning look your way.

And we are finally, *finally* back! I admit, I haven't caught up on all the posts since I put PMAS on hiatus, but hey, it's time to get some momentum back, and here we are with a slightly shorter post that re-sets the stage and presents a little dilemma. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

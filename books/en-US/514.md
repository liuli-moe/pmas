# On a Rail pt. 31

She's thinking about it. You've gotten through to her, even if just the slightest bit, and that's enough to kindle a spark of hope in your chest.

"That's true," you agree. "You can't just... change yourself by thinking it. But... Hm."

You release Mami's hair, allowing it to uncoil back into its usual drill shape. Instead, you find her hand. Interlacing your fingers with hers, you give her a quick squeeze. She smiles back at you, a little strained, but happy for you nevertheless.

It's nice.

"Do you have something in mind?" Oriko asks expression returning to its usual polite blankness.

"I..." you chew your lip. "Kind of. I *know* for a fact that it's possible for powers from a rejected Wish to come back. It's not easy, but it's possible, and generally it doe-"

The realisation strikes you like a bolt from the blue, a thought crystallising in your mind.

"Sabrina?" Mami asks, peering at you.

You shut your mouth with a click. "I... I think I've just had a very important realisation," you say, turning the thought over in your mind and examining it. "Kirika, your... your Wish. What was it?"

"Hm?" The black haired girl blinks at you. "I wished to be someone useful to my Oriko." The seer in question puts her hand on the small of Kirika's back, wrapping her in a gentle hug.

"Yeah... yeah, you did," you say slowly as you think it over. "And it gave you antimagic. Which... yes, is useful to fight other magical girls. Like Homura, or myself. But... antimagic."

"Yes, so?" Kirika says, sounding confused.

"No... well- Oriko, you don't *need* your powers to be able to help or find the meaning of your life," you say, suddenly sure of your conclusion. "Kirika wanted to help *you*, and her Wish gave her *antimagic*."

"I don't see your point," Oriko says.

"No, I-" you wave your hand. "Wishes grant you what you want. They grant you what you *want*. Kirika wanted to help *you*, and correct me if I'm wrong, Kirika, but you didn't just want to be Oriko's soldier and fight for her, you wanted to be *with* her and help *her*, right?"

"Um, yes," Kirika says. "Duh."

That earns her the slightest hint of a blush from Oriko, which is adorable but besides the point right now.

"Yeah, and... your power will reflect that," you say. Mami squeezes your hand encouragingly. "And I mean - you *did* help Oriko with your powers, and it's, uh, how do I put this-"

"You're saying that I got antimagic powers when I Wished to help Oriko because it's like, my Wish is trying to tell Oriko she doesn't need her powers to live," Kirika says.

"That's exactly what I'm trying to say," you agree. "It's, agh, magic is subtle like that? Does that make sense?"

"But antimagic is the perfect counter in combat," Oriko points out. "Why wouldn't Kirika have gotten it?"

"As opposed to, say, mind control," you counter. "And besides, Kirika Wished for you. And she got... basically magic's great hint to *you*."

"I... see," Oriko says. Her eyes are wide. Genuinely surprised for perhaps the first time since you'd met her. "I don't know. My vision..."

"Oriko..." you chide. Mami closes her other hand on top of yours, lacing her fingers through.

"I know," she says, a hint of exasperation creeping into her voice. "Your confidence in our Wishes cuts both ways. Why would I be granted my visions if not to see?"

"Well, yes, you are, but as I've established, I think you're seeing -or rather looking at- the wrong thing," you counter. "Which segues nicely into what I want to say, anyway. Oriko, please? Just... please. *Try* to find happiness for yourself. I know. It's hard. But... hey. Try?"

"I suppose I must," Oriko says, with a wry smirk.

You break out into a grin. That's more progress than you've ever gotten. "Good," you say emphatically. "That's all I can ask for. Is there anything we can get you? Books, movies, games?"

"We have the internet," Kirika pipes up, squirming around to face you properly. "Yaarrrr\~" She wiggles her fingers at you.

"Oh, sure, but it's not the same, and I'm sure there are things you want," you say.

"Some fresh groceries would be nice," Oriko says, settling back into the sofa. She seems mildly distracted, attention darting between you and Kirika.

"Chocolate!" Kirika chirps, grinning at you. "Uh, cooking chocolate, too, right, Oriko?"

"Uh, yes. Cooking chocolate, thank you for the reminder, dear," Oriko says.

"Right. Sure you don't want any games or anything?" you ask, starting to get to your feet.

"No, we have enough entertainment," Oriko says.

"Yup!" Kirika says, hopping to her feet.

"Right, then," you say, turning to give Mami a hand up. "I... well. Do try, Oriko? Please?"

The seer shrugs with one shoulder. "I can't make any promises."

"Trying is enough," you say.

She dips her head in acquiescence. "Dear, would you see them out?"

"Sure," Kirika says with a bright grin as she hops lightly to her feet.

"Right," you say. You dissolve the privacy field with a thought, relaxing as the ever-present *pressure* fades from your senses. Then again, you'd managed to not think about it for the entire time, really.

Mami gives you a smile, bumping her shoulder against yours, and with a laugh, you sling your arm around her waist. You say your goodbyes to Oriko, and head out.

"Hey, Sabrina?" Kirika pauses at the glass door.

"Mm?" you ask, turning to face her.

"'m not stupid," Kirika says, twiddling her fingers together. "You think that Oriko's purpose in life is *me*?"

"Well..." you say. "Pretty much, yeah."

Kirika blushes, *hard*. "Right. Right. Gotcha," she says.

"You remember what I said, right?" you ask. "She can be wrong. She *is* wrong about wanting to die, and... I think your magic is proof that she is. Her magic says one thing, and *your* magic says that you shouldn't listen to it."

"Get her to be happy, to live, to love," Kirika says, a luminescent, distant smile on her face. "Yeah, I remember. It's... hard. I forget how to say no to her."

"Mm," you agree. "Still... I'll ask from you the same thing I asked from Oriko. Try? Please?"

Kirika grins fiercely, little fang protruding. "Yeah, I can do that. I mean, I know I said that last time too, but like, you know what I mean," she says. "Thanks, 'brina. Though, uh..."

You raise an eyebrow at her fidgeting. "Yeah?"

"About letting us out, sometime?" Kirika asks, rubbing her lip.

- [x] Ask Oriko and Kirika if there's anything you can get them to help them pass the time (books, games, movies?), then depart and ask Homura for a timestop.

I'll be honest - I've been sitting on and giggling about the anti-magic thing for literally years at this point. Granted, the schedule got brought up a fair bit, but still! ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

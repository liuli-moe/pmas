# Direct Intervention pt. 39

"Not enough of a reason, then?" you ask idly. You'd shrug, but you need to keep your hands steady for the healing process. "Alright, then, how's this for some reasons? First of all, it would help to foster trust. We'd all be more effective if everyone could work together without friction. Can you deny that the three of us -you, me, and Mami- work together very well?"

Homura shakes her head reluctantly.

"Mmm. Mami sees you as an ally, now, at least, but small talk, favourite foods, that kind of thing... lets her see you as a *person*," you explain. "Which ties into my second point. Madoka would be happier, if you could socialize a little more. She cares for you, you know?"

"Her safety is more important," Homura bites out. "And Mami is-"

"Yes, Mami is *the* magical girl cheerleader," you interrupt her. "Or *is* she? Has she done that, within the last two days?"

"No," Homura admits reluctantly.

"Not to put too fine a point on it, she has *us*, now, as sisters in arms, so she's already doing better," you point out. "And if you can be a friend, or at least a *person* to her, then so much the better. Now, regarding your other point. Are you *honestly* telling me that it wouldn't be easier to protect her if you didn't have to stalk her from a distance? Really?"

"Being closer to her means that she knows more about magical girls," Homura bites out.

"And that-" you break off your first point, and frown. It's all very well to say that she'd know more about the *horrors* of being a magical girl, but with Mami and *you* around, it'd be both inadvisable and difficult to sell that particular point. Between the three of you, you probably make it look downright *glamorous*. "If you were closer to them, you could convince Madoka that we have this well in hand, and that she doesn't need to make a contract. I'd help, of course."

You shake your head. "Look. In the end... Protecting Madoka is a full time job, I get that. It doesn't mean you don't deserve a little happiness here and there, you know. Just... think about it, Homura. It does you no harm to be a little sociable."

A long silence, and you study Homura. She's looking away, unwilling to meet your eyes, and... a flash of distant pain in her eyes.

You sigh, and continue with the healing process. Looks like it's going to be a long, boring process.

"I've *tried* that before." Homura's voice is quiet, and almost inaudible. "You should *know* this. I ha- I won't-" she breaks off.

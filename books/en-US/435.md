# This mortal coil pt. 30

Success. *Success*.

You grin at Mami, pulling her into an exuberant hug. "You did it, Mami!" you squeal into her hair. "I knew you could do it!"

"Ah... I'm glad I could do something," Mami says, ducking her head.

"No," you say, pulling back and smiling at her. "*You* did this, Mami. *You* did this, and you made something *usable* out of what I did."

She shakes her head, but she can't hide the delighted smile on her face as she hugs you back.

"Thank you, Tomoe Mami." Oriko's quiet voice has you glancing over at the seer.

Kirika bounces off Oriko's lap. "Yeah! Thank you, Mami!" she chirps, gloom vanishing and good mood restored.

"It was no problem," Mami says, smiling a little at Kirika. The expression turns stiff when her eyes meet Oriko's, however, smile faltering.

The seer nods slowly in acknowledgement.

If Mami's gracious smile and nod is still a little strained, well... you'll take it as *some* progress.

You tighten your hug around her, drawing her attention back to you. "Thank you, Mami, for indulging me on this," you say. "*I know you didn't really want to help Oriko, so... Thank you, Mami, so much.*"

"You thought it was for the best, so I'm glad to have helped," Mami says, smiling warmly at you.

You smile back at her, meeting warm, golden eyes with nothing but absolute, unshakeable trust in you.

A minute later, she steps back, still smiling. "What's next, Sabrina?"

You exhale, smiling around at the others. "OK. This buys us a little time - Oriko, your Soul Gem is still... odd." You double check to confirm that this *is*, indeed, the case. "But it's getting kind of late, so... we'll see you tomorrow, OK? We're not done here."

Oriko nods. "I understand," she says. "My visions are still... sluggish, but the pain is gone. I'll be fine."

"Aw," Kirika says, shoulders slumping. "OK."

"Alright," you say, rolling your neck and summoning a blob of Grief to your hands. This... this is something that's been bothering you for a while, whether you can do it. And there's really no better time to settle it. "Let me try one last thing before we go, OK? This is gonna feel kinda Witchy, and it'll probably take a few minutes." You smile reassuringly at Mami.

She smiles back at you, a touch of worry on her face, but she nods. "Alright," she says.

You glance at Kirika and Oriko. They nod in acquiesence too, so you set your feet and raise the blob of Grief between both hands.

You focus.

A deep breath in...

Soul Gems. A manual on how Soul Gems work. You *push* with your mind, reaching with that odd sense of *control* you have over Grief. *Knowledge*.

Knowledge that feels like it's *there* but not quite within your grasp. Out of your *reach*, even if you *strain* to try and *take* it-

... and out.

You wipe at the sweat beading on your brow. You roll your shoulders again, now dense knots of tension, and you wince. The sphere of Grief in your hands remains mockingly unchanged.

"Sabrina?" Mami asks.

"I'm OK," you say, letting your hands drop so that the blob of Grief hangs in the air. You banish it out of the window. "Didn't work, is all." You grimace, rolling your neck and your shoulders both.

"Eh," Kirika says, shrugging. "Win some, lose some, yeah?"

"Yeah," you agree. "Anyway, cleanses for everyone?"

You take a look at Oriko's Gem as you cleanse it. Maybe it's your imagination, but you'd swear the *fire* that is her magic is *tightening* on itself. You'd compared it to a klein bottle earlier, and that's not a *bad* analogy - the *loop* is shrinking.

Oriko and Kirika see you to the big glass door, opening into the rose garden. Kirika beams at you as you step outside. "Thanks for helping, Sabrina," she says, patting you on the shoulder.

"Thank Mami," you say, tilting your head at her.

"Already did," Kirika says, grinning. "Now I'm thanking *you*."

"You're welcome," you say, smiling back as you form a Grief carpet. "Anyway... See you all tomorrow, OK?"

"Yeah, see you," Kirika says, stepping back.

Oriko nods, waving with her one working hand. "Tomorrow."

Mami's already sitting on the carpet when you turn back to it, and to your surprise, doesn't immediately curl into your side when you sit on it. You look askance at her, but she simply smiles back at you.

You lift into the air, Kirika waving enthusiastically as she shrinks away beneath you. Mami shuffles around behind her, and sets her hands on your shoulders. Strong fingers start to knead and massage at your trapezius muscles, soothing away the tension.

She's *good* at it, and you slowly relax, the knots melting away under her hands as you soar over Mitakihara. You groan, working the muscles and letting your mind wander, briefly considering the vaguely terrifying idea of Homura with *more* guns.

"*Thank you, Mami,*" you say.

"*It's just a massage,*" she demurs, never ceasing her ministrations.

"*No, not that,*" you say. "*Though thank you for this, too, it feels *amazing*. Just... thank you for helping today, Mami.*"

"*It was nothing,*" she says. "*Ah, there's something I'm curious about.*"

"*Mmm?*" She's changing the subject, but you suppose you'll let her.

"*Um... Mikuni Oriko,*" Mami asks. "*I suppose that house was her father's?*"

"*It is,*" you agree. Where's she going with this, you wonder.

"*I thought so. She... doesn't seem to be taking care of it,*" she says.

"*Mmm... She can't really do much with just one hand,*" you say. "*And Kirika doesn't, uh, strike me as much of a *cleaning* person, you know? And honestly... I'm not sure she likes the house much, other than as somewhere to live.*"

Mami chuckles, her laughter light and cheerful. "*That's true. And that would make sense.*"

"*Is something on your mind?*" you prompt.

"*Not really...*" Mami says. "*The rose bush in the backyard... that was *you*, wasn't it?*"

You blink in surprise. "*... well, yeah,*" you admit. "*Why?*"

"*Oh, Sabrina,*" Mami says fondly, her massage stopping for a moment so that she can hug you from behind. "*Only you.*"

That's *probably* true. "*Any particular reason?*"

"*No, I was just wondering. It seemed so out of place, you know?*" she responds, pulling back from the hug and returning to the massage.

You shrug. "*I wanted to test something, and Oriko didn't like the bushes.*"

"*Mmm,*" Mami says, her chuckles filling your mind.

You continue chatting happily as you fly back home, landing the carpet on the roof of the apartment block and dissolving it back into Grief to join the rest. You walk down to Mami's apartment and immediately flop on the sofa, not even bothering to detransform.

Mami giggles, sitting at the end of the sofa by your head. "Tired?" she asks.

"Meh," you say, sitting up. "Just lots of things happening."

"Mmm," she says, shuffling over to nestle into your side. "You take so much on yourself, Sabrina."

Because there might be no one better to do it. You *try* not to be arrogant, but... it *is* a fact that there's essentially no one who knows as much as you do about the entire story playing out here. Speaking of which, you do need to tell Mami. Later.

You exhale. "Anyway," you say, smiling at Mami. "You need to study, right?"

"Ah, yes," Mami says, her smile fading a little. "I... I'm not sure how much I can get done tonight, though..."

"I'll help you study," you offer, smiling. "If you want?"

"Of course I do," she says, already walking to her school bag to pull out her textbook and a thick sheaf of notes.

You help her clear the table, and settle down beside her. The two of you study into the night, you helping to quiz her and explain the concepts she has trouble with.

Eventually, she sighs, sitting back and glancing at the clock. Eleven thirty. "I don't think I'll get any more studying done tonight," she admits. "I need to sleep."

Spoiler: Vote in abeyance

\[x]Afterwards, time permitting, gently bring up that we'd like to talk about something, if she wants to. Does she remember the...things we said we weren't sure we were ready to talk about before? We'd like to talk to her about one of them, if she's okay with that and wants to hear it now. If not, that's okay.
\-\[x]This...It doesn't change how much we care about her. We wouldn't leave her.
\-\[x]Tell Mami about the metaknowledge after setting up Kyubey-proofing if she wants to talk about it. Not just that we knew about the system and other things, but that we knew things about her past when we first met, as impossible as that was. About other girls we hadn't met yet too, like Kyoko. Madoka. Even things like Sayaka's costume and who she might have wished for. We really don't know how, and we're sorry we kept that from her- both at the time and for this long. But we were...scared to talk about it at first.
\[x]If Mami didn't want to study or talk about it, go to sleep.\[/b]

Great success.

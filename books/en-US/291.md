# Interloper pt. 4

You sigh as you fall in behind Kyouko. Yuma glances back, still gnawing on the pocky stick, and gives you a happy little wave that you can't help but smile at before turning your attention back to Kyouko's question. She *would* go for the hard question first, huh?

"*No, she didn't,*" you say, shaking your head with a quiet sigh. "*I told her I'd be here, but sticking my nose into everyone else's business is entirely my own idea. And honestly... She's not doing well."* You blurt out that last line before you can lose your nerve.

Kyouko stops dead, Yuma continuing on a step before herself being brought up short by her hand, held in the redhead's. Kyouko half turns, glancing at you sidelong with narrowed eyes. "Oh?" she drawls, her posture loose and deliberately relaxed.

You... should probably explain. "Yeah," you say, keeping your hands hanging neutrally at your sides. "She... she gets morose. *Withdrawn*, if I so much as bring you up."

Faded crimson eyes narrow slightly.

Yuma glances anxiously up at her adopted big sister, then at you.

You meet Kyouko's eyes squarely. "You know Kyuubey. The little white rat was *using* Mami. She didn't take the news well."

With a loud, expressive crunch, Kyouko bites through the pocky stick in her mouth, and she holds her hand up to the stick, shoving it fully into her mouth, before replacing it. "Shi-" she chokes off the word, lips flattening together. Her jaw works for a moment, before she pivots sharply and stalking off, towing Yuma along by the hand.

"Owie, owie, big sis, you're hurting Yuma," the younger girl cries, almost dragged bodily along with the crimson haired girl's longer strides.

Kyouko flinches, stopping in her tracks and abruptly releasing Yuma's hand. "Shit. Sorry, Yuma," she says.

"It's OK, big sis," Yuma says, reaching out to pat the back of Kyouko's hand.

Slowly, Kyouko turns her hand to take Yuma's again, before glancing back at you. "Well?" she says challengingly. "We eatin'?"

"Yeah, yeah," you say, flapping a hand at her.

Kyouko snorts, and stalks off, radiating anger. You note, though, that she's shortening her strides to match Yuma's shorter legs.

*Teenagers.*

You trail after the pair.

"Cleansing's still an unconditional offer, by the way," you call after the redhead. "I'd *like* to do it for filled Grief Seeds, yes, filled, since otherwise they'd be wasted."

"Filled Grief Seeds hatch into Witches, lady," Kyouko snaps.

"So half fill them," you say.

"'Half fill them' she says." Kyouko affects a nasal tone, but continues on, gait unbroken. "Well *la-di-da*."

... She probably can't afford that, can she? You fall silent, continuing on.

"*Sabrina?*" Mami, of course.

"*Hey, Mami,*" you say, as Kyouko steps out of the park, lush greenery giving way to the bustle of the streets. "*How was basketball?*"

"*Ah... we won!*" Mami says.

"*That's great,*" you say warmly. "*What are you doing now?*"

"*Oh, I just finished showering, we're waiting for our next class,*" Mami explains. "*It's math, next!*"

"*Mmm. Still on integration by parts?*" you ask. You're... pretty impressed with the curriculum, you think, for a *middle school*.

"*Ah, yes,*" Mami says. "*I think we're doing class practice today.*"

"*Makes sense,*" you agree, following Kyouko as she saunters across the road, enormously voluminous ponytail swaying behind her. "*I'm sure you won't have trouble, Mami.*"

"*Thank you,*" Mami says. "*Um... Do you know of you'll be able to make it for lunch?*"

"*I think so, and I'll try my best, Mami,*" you reassure her for what must be the hundredth time.

"*Alright,*" Mami says happily. "*See you, Sabrina!*"

"*See you, Mami,*" you reply.

You eventually find yourself in front of the same buffet restaurant as last time. At this time of the day, there's no queue at all, and the three of you secure a corner booth. You pay, of course, handing over the money without complaint.

Kyouko watches, and departs for the buffet line with Yuma at her side, the two returning with heavily laden plates. You collect one of your own, and by the time you return with your sparsely laden plate, Kyouko's already departing for her second.

You eye the remains -bones and gravy- on her plate, and Yuma, still working slowly through her own plate. She peeks at you with her huge blue eyes, before returning to her food.

As you eat slowly, you watch Kyouko collecting food, piling her plate high.

The redhead slams back down into her seat as you chew thoughtfully on a mouthful of barbecued pork, and bites into her own food with voracious speed, biting down angrily on the food as of it offended her.

You clear your throat. "So, uh," you say, watching the food vanish down Kyouko's mouth just about as fast as she can shovel it in. "We stopped Oriko. She and Kirika are... fine, but we're keeping them under house arrest."

Kyouko clears her mouth for long enough to give you a withering glare and a, "Well, good for you," before returning to tearing the meat off a chicken drumstick, polishing it clean in three swift bites.

"*Sabrina?*" Yuma's voice sounds in your head, quavering timidly.

You glance at her - the younger girl is, to all outward appearances, still concentrating on her food. You look back at your own food, picking up a drumstick. "*Yes, Yuma?*"

"*Why is big sis so angry?*" Yuma asks. "*Who's Mami?*"

\[x] Inform her about the end of the Sendai conflict.
\[x]*Just in case you didn't know already...a Walpurgisnacht's going to hit Mitakihara in about three weeks. I'm not here to try and recruit you for it-especially because you have Yuma to look after-but since it might still cause a lot of damage, I thought you should know.*

# Lowlife pt. 14

Homura stares at the two Soul Gems in her hand. Two fragile lives, cradled in shaking fingers.

"I-" you begin, and find words failing you. What do you even *say* at this point?

Oriko's being way too melodramatic? Well, she is.

She's backsliding? You're not entirely sure she is. She wants to live, or at least she said as much, she's just... incapable of not being an absurd, self-destructive drama queen.

She's *trying*? She sort of is, you suppose. She's making it an offering of sorts. 'It' being her actual and literal life, in exchange for trust.

She's putting some actual trust in Homura? *You* know you trust Homura. You don't think she'd actually kill Oriko or Kirika without a truly good reason to do so, not at this point, and... you suppose Oriko knows that too. You could characterize what Oriko's doing as trust in that.

People aren't logical. Emotions aren't logical, to paraphrase a certain white rat. Homura's emotions about Oriko aren't logical. Trust isn't logical, and a gesture this big is as much *symbol* as anything. The melodrama is, perhaps, part of the *point*.

You...

You're pinching the bridge of your nose, is what you are. You shift to rubbing at your face, half-exasperation and half *frustration* with the melodramatic, martyr-ish but mostly well-meaning idiot Oriko is.

"What the *hell*," Sayaka mutters again, staring at the Soul Gems now back in Homura's hand. "What just happened?"

"A gesture of peace, I suppose," Mami says quietly.

"A *stupid* one," Sayaka grumbles.

You laugh. Just a short, sharp bark of laughter, muffled by the palm of your hand, but it feels *good* to just... let go of some of the frustration.

"You know what?" you say, grinning up at Sayaka and Homura's expressions. "You're not wrong, Sayaka. I... I mean, I kind of get what Oriko was trying to do, but no, you're kind of right, too. She's just..."

"An idiot," Sayaka supplies.

"Again, not wrong," you agree, and sigh as you sober up. "I'm... Homura? Are you alright?"

"Explain," Homura says. Her gaze shifts from the Soul Gems to yours, hard amethyst clouded with confusion and incomprehension.

"Gladly," you say with a warm smile. "I'm happy to offer my thoughts, but... just that. I'm not going to tell you what to do, OK?"

Homura nods jerkily, and out of the corner of your eye, you can see Sayaka folding her arms slowly, regarding the two of you with a thoughtful look. Some part of you worries that she might be starting to put things together, and some part of you wonders if that might be a *bad* thing, and some other part of you complains that Sayaka ~~who is definitely an angel of Madokami~~ should really be the bigger person and *stop messing with you already*.

"Well... honestly, as dramatic as all this is," you begin slowly. "Oriko really *is* trying here. I mean, we talked about... concrete proof, and guarantees of trustworthiness, right? I guess Oriko was thinking about it too. Talking about it."

"I can't say that I approve of her methods," Mami notes. "Better than her previous ones, but she does seem to be a rather... all or nothing person."

Homura's eyes go to her, the lines of tension clear in her face and her shoulders.

Mami shakes her head, smiling gently. "I think Sabrina has more insight here, but I was just thinking that she truly does seem to throw herself into things, to the detriment of others."

"Well, yeah," you say. "Mami's not wrong, I think. She made this offer of her own free will, and I think that's significant, considering how little Kirika *or* Oriko herself seem to like it as an idea. But trust is a two-way street, and I guess... she took the first step."

"I *don't* trust her," Homura snaps.

Sayaka's attention swivels from you to Homura, blue eyes alive with curiosity she visibly tamps down on.

"And I'm not saying you have to," you say. "But... that's why she did it. It's a gesture, an offering, that she's willing to *start*."

"But we were already gonna bring her along, right?" Sayaka asks. "I get what she's doing, but I mean we were *already* planning on bringing her along."

"Again, it's about trust," you say, shaking your head. "*Technically* speaking, with Homura's power, and that we were gonna have Mami ready to disconnect and other stuff... well, if they acted up at any point, we just... y'know. But it's a *symbol*."

"I don't want this," Homura bites out, glaring at the Soul Gems in her hand. "I don't-" She shakes her head.

"And that's fine, if that's what you prefer. You can just give them back," you say softly. "We already had our own contingencies prepared, so we can just stick with those, right?"

"Right," Homura mutters.

"... hey, Homs," Sayaka says.

Homura's attention snaps up, glaring at Sayaka, to which the bluenette only responds with a sunny grin rivalling one of yours.

"Thought that might get your attention," she says. "Yeah, so... listen. I'm pretty sure I'm missing more than half the story here, but uh... just talking about *those*. I mean, I guess Sabrina kind of said it already, but putting your life in someone else's hands is a pretty big gesture. It feels like..." Sayaka grimaces. "It feels like Oriko's saying she can trust you. Or maybe that she trusts Sabrina, since she's here and stuck into everything? I dunno where I was going with this, ignore me."

Homura stares at Sayaka for a long, long moment.

"... what?" Sayaka raises an eyebrow, obviously trying not to fidget. "Something I said?"

Homura turns to you, face blank. You're pretty good at reading Homura, at this point, but you're not sure what she's thinking this time, barring the tension still in her shoulders and the stress lines etching deeper into her face.

She thrusts her hand towards you, Soul Gems held out. "I don't want this," she enunciates clearly.

"... neither do I," you say, blinking at Homura. You reach out, and hesitate before closing your hand over the Soul Gems in her hand. "I... what are you thinking, Homura? Get us all on the same page?"

"It doesn't make a difference," Homura says, her tone measured and controlled. "We were already going to bring them along. This..." She gestures with the Gems. "This doesn't make a difference."

"Are you sure, Homura?" Mami asks, clear concern on her face. "It *is* a... powerful guarantee."

"You can disconnect them just as easily," Homura says evenly. Her eyes flicker over to you for a second. "That's a better guarantee."

"Then..." You consider it for a second, and withdraw your hand slowly. "If you're sure, Homura, and *if* you're willing, I think *you* should be the one to return the Gems to them. I know you don't trust them still, but it's still a gesture of... acceptance, I suppose, to working together for this."

Homura hesitates, still holding the Soul Gems out.

"It's fine that you don't trust them," you add quietly. "And if you want me to do it, that's absolutely fine, too. But to them, I think it would mean more if *you* gave them back, and maybe it would help establish the beginning of *them* accepting *you*. Small steps, that's all."

Some part of you registers a thought, a question, an answer: that Homura might never have had an opportunity to really learn, or to learn *how* to learn. Where would she have? The orphanage? In the hospital? Right after being precipitated from the hospital and into magical girl life? During the endless grind of the loops?

Perhaps never.

There's more to that thought, you feel, but it's something to unpack later.

For now\... you offer up an explanation, offer up a warm smile and uncompromising acceptance for Homura.

"... alright," Homura says.

Sayaka snorts, sounding amused. "Gee, Homura, it's no big deal, right? You're just giving them back their lives."

Homura shrugs again, twitching her head towards the house. "Let's go," she murmurs, and suits action to word, striding off towards the house.

Mami smiles at you, squeezing your arm gently as you leave the frozen grey rosegarden and the frozen grey dome of rain behind. You return the smile, exhaling slowly.

This is as good a result as you could have asked for, you think. You'd been prepared to offer up tactical considerations, especially with regards to how *odd* it'd seem to your allies for Homura to be holding three Soul Gems, but Homura's simply giving them back of her own free will.

Oriko and Kirika are still curled up on the sofa, arms wrapped around each other when you enter, but their attention is already fixed on the door as the three of you file through - they can't possibly have missed your footsteps against the absolute silence of Homura's timestop.

Homura marches over, wordlessly thrusting their Soul Gems at them, Mami simultaneously extending ribbons to keep them linked together.

Oriko stares at Homura, expression flickering between confusion and hope. "I-"

Kirika swipes both Soul Gems from Homura's hand, immediately clutching them to her chest. Homura, in turn, takes a long step backwards the moment the Soul Gems leave her hand, wary glare riveted to the couple.

"What is this?" Oriko asks quietly.

"You might be useful," Homura grates out, her voice stiff, and turns her gaze to you, her tolerance apparently expended for now.

"You knew what you were doing when you handed over your Soul Gem," you say, raising an eyebrow. You motion at Homura. "And it's hard not to understand what you were trying for, but... for goodness' sake, Oriko. Kirika, have you spritzed your wife for being an inconsiderate doofus yet?"

Mami giggles quietly even as Sayaka's palm meets her face with a loud smack.

"No," Kirika mumbles, still cradling both Soul Gems close. "Pr'bly should've. Was too upset."

You sigh, rubbing your forehead wearily.

"Ugh," you say. "Well... you're coming, if you're still up for it, so we can talk on the way. But seriously, Oriko. I get what you were doing, and I'm sure you can figure out why *I'm* at least somewhat annoyed with you. And so help me if the next words out of your mouth are some variant on 'it was necessary' I *will* dunk you in the next pond we fly over."

Oriko opens her mouth, and then closes it thoughtfully.

"Anyway. Shall we go? We've got a lot more pickups to make," you say.

"I hope you apologised to Kirika," Mami notes quietly. "I think she deserves one, don't you?"

"I did," Oriko says. "I did."

"Good," Mami says, nodding.

Kirika makes a soft, protesting noise when Oriko shifts to stand.

"Dear..." Oriko murmurs.

Kirika grumbles quietly, but stands herself, pulling Oriko with her.

"Let's go, then," you say.

And now there are six of you. Seven, if you count the awkward silence, which quite frankly has nearly as much physical presence as any of you on your Mobile Oppression Platform as you speed through the sky. Grief fog billows out ahead of you, batting aside motionless raindrops and damping the roar of wind.

"So," you say, pivoting your chair to face your friends. "First things first, rough itinerary: We're going to pick up Kyouko, Yuma, Mika, Noriko and Akemi, then head over to Fukushima to collect them, drop Miss Akiyama back here in Mitakihara, then off to Kasamino to pick up the Pleiades."

"Have you determined anything more about the Iowa group?" Oriko asks.

"Not much, other than their location," you say. "I'm hoping Akemi, Noriko, and Miss Tsuruya might have more info - we'll have to discuss it when everyone's picked up." You make a face. "The problem with these staggered pickups is that either we have to go through the same info multiple times, or we're going to have to wait until we grab everyone."

Oriko shrugs slightly, settling back with Kirika curling a little tighter into her side.

"Also, so... Kirika, I don't suppose you could make some antimagic enchantments on the way over?" you ask. "It'll be good to have an option *other* than Gemming people... and I think you've met everyone who's coming, barring the first three we're going to pick up, so you can key it to us."

"... yeah, sure," Kirika says, apparently only half paying attention to you as she rubs her face against Oriko's shoulder, cat-like.

"I'll make sure she does it," Oriko notes quietly.

"Thanks," you say, flashing them a quick smile before sobering to a frown. "... And Oriko? Again, I understand what you were trying to do." You glance at Homura, then back to Oriko. "I... look, I'll keep this brief. Speaking personally, I appreciate you making the first move. But like Mami said - you owe Kirika an apology, and more. It's something you should talk out when this is done."

"I am aware," Oriko says quietly, eyes fixed on Kirika. "I... I *am* aware of what I have to potentially lose, Sabrina. As I mentioned, I have reasons to want to *live*."

Kirika opens her eyes, staring up at Oriko, and leans up to give her a gentle kiss. You avert your eye politely, trying not to listen, either, but given the proximity, you can't help but overhear her words.

"I love you, always, but Sabrina's right," Kirika murmurs. "We *are* going to talk."

"I know," Oriko says.

You swallow, facing forward once more, and even Homura, in the back row, seems vaguely uncomfortable. Mami sighs, leaning her head against your shoulder.

"Also, so..." You raise your voice, cutting through the cloying awkwardness. "I know the silence can get to people a bit, so I'm taking requests for music?"

You get blank stares from your friends, apart from Mami, who just giggles, beaming at you.

"Maybe Credens Justitiam to start with?" Mami says, giving you a warm look.

"Sure!" you say, beaming. And rather than forming discrete instruments -you *could*, but this feels more elegant- you use the entire *floor* of your Mobile Oppression Platform as a speaker, the energetic drums and crooning strings carrying through the still air.

**\[x] Vote in abeyance
\- \[x] Enchant some more Grief along the way
\- \[] Anything to add?
\-- \[] Try and talk through the awkwardness
\-- \[] Just leave it be for now**

Spoiler: Vote in abeyance

\-\[X] For yourself, ask Kirika if she can make antimagic enchantments with what you have handy. You'd rather not gem people if there's a better way and you think she's met or fought everyone on our side but Mika, Akemi, and Noriko already, all of whom are in town to be picked up early.
\[X] Overarching flight goals: In the time before you arrive in SEA you need...
\-\[X] to understand your opponents as best as possible so you aren't taken by surprise
\-\[X] to make sure you and your allies all know enough about each other to fight together effectively

\[X] Gather Mitakihara and head to Fukushima. Plans for the first leg, to Fukushima and back to drop off Atsuko:
\-\[X] You're going to need a bigger Mobile Operations Platform. Make a full on flying saucer.
\-\[x] Put on some music or other white noise in the background. (Take requests.)
\-\[X] Given that you're going halfway to space by the end of this, and general utility, can you use grief fog sensors instead of windows? Can you make a "very foggy array?" (Thousands of mechanical grief micro cameras distributed throughout your fog and/or the hull of the MOP. Do not trance.)
\-\[X] Gather basic info prior to a bigger tactical discussion once you've picked everyone up.
\--\[X] Generally offer your enchanted grief for any one tool your friends might need and don't have, with a note on the limits of what you can make

\=====​

There. The next update should be the pickup of everyone else, and finally arriving for the confrontation proper!

Believe me when I say I've been looking forward to this as much as you have, but I really wanted to finish an update tonight, so... ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

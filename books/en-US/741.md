# Lowlife pt. 7

You wind up arranging yourselves in a loose line, overlapping your umbrella as best as you can with Homura's to give Nagisa more coverage, Mami with her arms wrapped around yours.

Admittedly, it would be nice if she actually stuck in one place for long enough to enjoy the benefit of more umbrella coverage, but she seems absolutely delighted to flit about, a splotch of bright yellow in her raincoat giggling as she stomps in the puddles of water. She gets tolerant smiles from other pedestrians as you all make your way to the looming specter of *Capitalism*.

Hrmph. Capitalism.

Shimachi Shopping Centre looms large, even shrouded by the downpour. Floodlights carve brilliant swathes through the sky, shining off raindrops to form solid beams that seem to pierce the very heavens, an impression lent credence by the flowing, marble-white lines of the building itself.

"*Heeey I'm almost at the shopping centre,*" Sayaka's voice fills your head. "*Anyone else here yet?*"

"*A-ah! We're getting ready to go, papa said he wanted to do some grocery shopping too, so he said he'd drive me over,*" Madoka says. "*Sorry...*"

"*I, too, am on my way, so don't feel bad about it, Madoka,*" Hitomi says. "*I thought it might be nice to take a walk, but I misestimated the time it would take...*"

"*... in this rain?*" you ask, a touch dubiously. Rain is nice and all, but this isn't so much *rain* as it is a *storm*.

"*Yes?*" Hitomi says.

"*... Eh. Fair enough, I guess,*" you say. Who are you to judge.

"*And anyway, I'm early!*" Sayaka says. "*Or... will be early, I guess, when I actually get there. So don't worry about it, Madoka. Sabrina, uh, I take it you're with Mami and Homura and Kyouko?*"

"*Kyouko didn't want to come,*" you say. "*She's gone Witch-hunting instead.*"

"*... Aw,*" Sayaka says. "*Shame.*"

"*What, looking forward to seeing her in new outfits?*" you tease lightly.

"*Eh? The jacket is kind of her style,*" Sayaka says. "*Was just looking forward to hanging out in a less, er...*"

"*Adversarial?*" Mami offers. She turns an amused look your way, and you grin, arching an eyebrow.

"*Less adversarial context!*" Sayaka completes triumphantly. "*Thanks, Mami.*"

"*Of course,*" Mami says. Her smile widens, just a hair, and your other eyebrow joins the first. She purses her lips, thoughtfully solemn, and you tip a shoulder up in response. The purse of lips turns into an amused smile, to which you respond to with a waggled hand, and a concerned quirk of your eyebrows. She nods decisively, and returns to laying her head against your shoulder as you continue onwards.

In fairness, you're not *entirely* sure that Sayaka's interested in Kyouko, or vice versa, but you *are* sure that they *could* be. All that remains is to properly arrange for them to spend time together and see what happens, and... you're glad Mami's on board with the idea, however complicated her own feelings about Kyouko are.

"*You've overshot,*" Homura murmurs.

"*Hmm? Shopping Centre's up ahea- oh, I see you,*" Sayaka says. "*Coming!*"

You look up just in time to see a blue streak of light loop back on itself, dipping down towards a building not that much further ahead of you. A moment later, as you pass the next side-street, Sayaka strolls out to join you, clad in a light blue jacket and bearing her own umbrella.

"Yo," she says cheerfully.

"Heya!" you say.

"Sorry for ditching the training session this morning," Sayaka says, falling in step on the far side of Homura. "Oh, hey Nagisa."

"Sayaka!" Nagisa bounces over, beaming. "Hi!"

"Terrifyingly adorable kid, aren't you?" Sayaka says. "Good to see you again."

Nagisa beams.

"Nah, if you had stuff to do, you had stuff to do," you say. "I hope the stuff went well?"

"Homework is homework," Sayaka says with a shrug. "Deeefinitely gonna need your help later if we're gonna go gallivanting about tomorrow, though. We're still up for that, right?"

"Assuming nothing comes up, yeah," you say. "And yeah, I already said I'd help."

"Eww, homework," Nagisa says. "Can big sis do my homework for me?"

"I'm not doing Sayaka's homework for her," you say, ignoring Sayaka's disappointed 'aw'. "I'm helping her understand it, so she can do it herself."

"But can big sis do *Nagisa's* homework for her?" Nagisa asks, clasping her hand and making the biggest, poutiest expression she can at you.

"... Bring it with you next time and I'll *help*," you say, because you are *weak*.

"Well... that would be OK," Nagisa says, after giving this a moment of solemn consideration, and returns to splashing on ahead.

"Oh, Sabrina," Mami says fondly.

"What?" you say.

Mami doesn't respond, simply returning to tucking her head against your shoulder. You feel eyes on you, and you aim aggrieved eyebrows at Sayaka, who, it turns out, is openly smirking at you.

"*What?*" you say.

"Oh, nothing," she says far too cheerfully.

"Hrmph," you grumble. Still, it's hard to feel *too* grumpy.

A blast of warm air greets you as you arrive at the shopping centre, the glass doors yawning open to admit the great flood of people who, like you, chose to brave the rain today. You leave your umbrellas behind at the lockers, and head into the the maw of commerce.

"Where're we going first?" Sayaka calls.

"Well what are we looking for today?" you respond. "I... well, I need to hit the bank first, I think, and maybe we should do that first before Madoka and Hitomi arrive?"

"Aw, banks are *boring*," Nagisa protests.

You smile at her apologetically. "Sorry, Nagisa. Just need to get a proper account set up for myself," you say, and continue telepathically - to Mami and Sayaka and Homura. "*Now that I've gotten proper ID, I mean. Well, 'proper'.*"

"Somehow, I figured you'd just share Mami's," Sayaka says.

Homura nods.

"I- I wouldn't mind that," Mami says, blushing hotly.

"There are... *practical* reasons to not," you say. Your cheeks *are* red. "Like the fact that, y'know."

You dip your hand in your pocket and pull out a gold bar, withdrawn from hammerspace in the same motion, and toss it at Sayaka.

"Wha- whoa!" Sayaka nearly fumbles the catch, blinking at you. "Oh. Uh. Fair enough, I guess."

"What's that?" Nagisa asks, going up on her tiptoes to peek at the bar.

"... Why don't you ask your big sis?" Sayaka says.

"It's a gold bar," you say cheerfully. "Banks don't like it when you can't really explain where your money comes from." You pause slightly. "Except when you're *really* rich, I suppose."

"Blech," Sayaka says, making a disgusted face as she passes the bar back to you.

"Oh," Nagisa says. "So... you can't explain where your money comes from?"

"Nope," you say.

"Oh," Nagisa repeats. "OK!"

"So... bank?" you say. "If everyone's OK with that?"

"Only if I get ice cream," Nagisa declares.

"You know, I could go for ice cream, too," Sayaka muses. "Sounds like a good recompense for having to queue for bank stuff..."

"Fine, fine, I'll treat everyone to ice cream," you say, amused and exasperated. "Happy?"

"Ice cream!" Nagisa cheers.

And that's why Hitomi and Madoka find you in the queue for ice cream. The DBJ branch at the shopping centre turned out to be shockingly efficient, and you barely had to wait ten minutes before being ushered into a quiet cubicle. And to your further surprise, they... don't actually question the fact that you have no legal guardian, or even the deposit of raw cash.

You got *understanding* looks during the entire process, for goodness' sake.

"Hey Hitomi, hey Madoka," you say, waving. "Do you guys ever think about watermelon?"

"Hello, Sabrina, hello, everyone," Hitomi says. She returns the wave with her newly cast-free hand, smiling. "Is that a joke about our hair colours?"

"*Pink* watermelon sounds terrible!" Madoka says, turning her nose up. "Proper watermelon should be a deep red. Hello everyone!"

"Hello," Homura says quietly. You flash her a grin for that before continuing with your thought.

"No, no, I mean yes they should, but also, I was thinking like..." You hold your hand out, miming it out. "Like... uh. A shelled watermelon. You take a watermelon and remove the rind, but as a... whole... thing." You trail off in vague bewilderment as you finish the thought.

Mami considers this for a moment. "I think I could do that," she says. "So could you, Sabrina."

"Yeah, probably," you say, frowning thoughtfully.

"... but *why* though?" Sayaka asks.

"I dunno, the thought just... kind of popped into my head," you say. "Maybe later."

"Now I want watermelon," Nagisa says.

"You know what, so do I," you muse. "Maybe we can pick one up later."

"After the ice cream, I hope," Hitomi says drily. "Speaking of which, may I get matcha?"

"Sure," you say, choosing not to comment that Hitomi's hair is *exactly* the same shade as matcha ice cream. "I'm treating everyone, so... Madoka?"

"Uhmm..." Madoka peeks at the array of flavours on display, wobbling back and forth indecisively as the queue proceeds forward. You're at the counter by the time she *does* make up her mind. "Apple pie!"

"... one apple pie, and uh... hm, make that two apple pie ice creams," you finish. "It *does* look good. Cone or cup, Madoka?"

"Cone, like everyone!" Madoka says.

"In a cone," you say, flashing an apologetic smile at the proprietor of the store. "Sorry for the trouble."

"No trouble at all, Miss," the man says genially. "I've seen worse. That will be five thousand six hundred yen, please."

You peel a few notes out of your bag and pass them over. Mental note to self: you should maybe get a purse, too, since you're shopping. Not a handbag, you've got a perfectly good one, a *purse*.

"What are we doing today?" Madoka asks. "I want to get some new socks, and papa asked me if I could take a look at more clothes for Tatsuya... he's growing too fast! Soon he'll be as big as papa and then I won't have an adorable *little* brother any more..."

"I, er, think you might be skipping a few steps there," Sayaka says.

"You know what? Tatsuya *is* adorable," you say. "C'mon, him and his chubby little cheeks and all."

"Here you are, Miss!" the ice cream man announces, handing over a tray laden with cones.

"Thank you!" you say, beaming, and nudge everyone to clear the counter before starting to hand out the ice creams. "Alright, so... that's strawberry and cream for Mami, chocolate for Homura, mint for Sayaka, matcha for Hitomi, apple pie for Madoka, and... what was it you wanted again, Nagisa?"

"Big siiii*iiiiis*..." Nagisa whines, stamping one foot.

"Ah, right, cheese ice cream," you say, plucking that second last cone off the tray. "And an apple pie for me. C'mon, let's get out of the way."

By mutual assent, you duck away from the flow of people to enjoy your ice creams - well, Nagisa started well before you made it to safety, devouring hers with happy abandon and getting it smeared all over her face. You savour your own with rather more decorum. Crispy, crumbled bits of crust and chunks of nicely caramelized apple mixed with cinnamon and vanilla ice cream. Madoka made an *excellent* choice, you have to admit.

"May I try some?" Mami asks.

"Of course," you say. "But only if I can try yours?"

"Fair's fair," Mami says, beaming. You swap ice creams, and then again after having a taste.

"So, what do we have on our itinerary today?" Hitomi enquires as she takes a bite of her ice cream. "Other than Madoka needing new socks and baby clothes for Tatsuya?"

"Oh yeah," Sayaka says, snapping her fingers. "Madoka! Who knows, maybe *you'll* wind up as tall as your father."

"Whaaat? Noooooo," Madoka whines, covering her head and cowering. "I don't wanna be so tall! I wanna be cute!"

"Bah, you'd still be cute no matter what," Sayaka says. She grins at Homura, sharklike. "Isn't that righ..."

Homura tilts her head just a bit to the side. Her eyes narrow a hair.

Sayaka shuts her mouth.

"Huh?" Madoka blinks. "Sayaka? Are you alright?"

"Yeah, uh..." Sayaka laughs awkwardly. "Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."

"I think *I* want to get some new clothes, actually," you say, stepping into the silence. "Formals, for... well, dinner with your parents tonight, Hitomi. And a purse! I can't just keep carting around loose cash."

"It's not that fancy an event," Hitomi says with an amused smile.

"Your standards of 'not fancy' are different from everyone elses', Hitomi," Sayaka says.

Hitomi rolls her eyes.

"Rolling your eyes at me, Miss Shizuki?" Sayaka says, voice shifting to a deliberately snotty, stuck-up version. "How uncouth!"

"I don't think you'd need anything more than smart casual, if you *must* dress up," Hitomi tells you, pointedly ignoring Sayaka. "We're not even going out to a restaurant or anything."

"It might be prudent to buy something, anyway," Mami says. "Even if you don't wear it tonight, it might be useful later, and now's as good a time as any, right? I could perhaps take a look, too."

"Right, and I was thinking it might be useful for meeting Tokyo and such, yeah," you say.

"Righty, fancy clothes boutique goes on the list, then," Sayaka says. "I wanna hit the music store."

"I could perhaps take a look at the new styles they might have while we're there too," Hitomi says.

"Uncle Shin keeps saying that I'll need new clothes soon, too!" Nagisa pipes up.

"Hmm?" You look at her pink, white-spotted dress in consideration. It *does* look like it's starting to get a little short. "And... oh, look at you. Does anyone have a spare napkin?"

Hitomi has wet tissues, it turns out, so you spend a few minutes fussing over Nagisa and the ice cream that she got *all over* her face. On her *eyelids*, for goodness' sake!

"I think I'd like to stop by the furniture store," Madoka announces as you finish wiping down Nagisa's face.

You freeze.

Homura does, too. Sayaka and Hitomi develop these awful, rigid grins, like someone cornered by their worst nightmare.

"... eh?" Nagisa says, looking around.

"I think they were supposed to be getting new styles today, too," Madoka says, happily oblivious to the horror rolling through the group. "And I think a new high stool would really bring the kitchen together, so I'll take a look at that?"

"... also, Mami," you say, making a desperate attempt to divert the topic to something else. *Anything* else. "Ah... I know I still have that flip phone that you bought for me, but I was thinking that it might be good to update to a smartphone? I... feel like it would be nice to have GPS navigation and Internet access on the go."

"Oh, that's fine," Mami says, smiling and hooking her arm around the crook of your elbow. "But only if you let me buy you the new one too?"

"I can't impose on you like that, Mami," you say.

"It's not an imposition," Mami says. "And besides, given that your phone is still so new, I'm sure we can do a trade-in."

"Ah, true," you say. "Well... if you're sure? *And* if you let me buy something nice for you in return."

"I don't need anything else as long as I have you," Mami says, smiling and cuddling a little closer to your arm. "But... if that's what it takes, then alright."

You laugh, and drop a gentle kiss on the crown of her head.

"Alrighty... Homura, is there anything you wanna get?" you ask. "I think we're hitting the clothes store first. Do you think you need any new clothes?"

"Oh, yeah, Homura, you *definitely* need something new to wear," Sayaka says. "I mean, the dress is nice and all, but it's not exactly..."

"It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi," Hitomi says.

"... it looks perfectly fine to me," Homura says, looking down at herself. It *is* a perfectly nice dress, in your opinion, loose and comfortable-looking and in a shade of lilac that brings out her eyes quite nicely. A bit damp from the rain, you'll grant.

"It does!" Madoka offers, beaming.

"But I bet we can do *better*," Sayaka says. "And c'mon, we're all gonna go shop around anyway, right?"

"You don't *have* to buy anything!" Madoka says. "But maybe you could try on something new, if you find something you like?"

"... I reserve the right to veto." Homura eyes Sayaka, then Madoka, in a way that suggests she feels like she's just sealed her own doom.

"Hel- heck yeah!" Sayaka cheers, punching the air.

You laugh cheerfully. "Alright, it's settled, then! Someone who knows the shopping centre better than I do lead, please," you say, beaming.

Hitomi takes the lead with an amused smile, and you usher everyone along, keeping Nagisa in particular in front of you. Sure, you could tag her with a bit of Grief -can and have, actually- but it's a big crowd, and you don't want *her* losing *you* in said crowd. Mami claims your free arm, smiling at you as she cuddles up, and you can't help but smile back.

"*By the way, Homura,*" you say as you follow Hitomi. "*On the note of buying things, do you think you want to buy a gift for Madoka or something?*"

"*Why?*" Homura asks blankly.

"*Just to do something nice for her?*" you say, slanting a smile her way. "*It's... I'm not forcing you to do it or anything, but I'm sure it'd make her happy, and *if you want*, there's an opportunity for it here, so... I'm asking, and offering to help make it happen.*"

"*... I'll think about it,*" Homura allows.

"*That's all I can ask for,*" you say.

You leave it at that, content to let Homura work through it on her own time. She still hasn't come to a decision by the time you reach the clothes section, but that's fine, because you have time.

"Department store first, regular boutiques, or fancy boutiques?" Sayaka asks.

"That does rather depend on budget," Hitomi muses.

"I would say that we could start at the department store first," Mami muses. "We could take a look at general styles and such to get an idea."

"Besides, we always have time for window shopping afterwards!" Sayaka says, grinning.

"Yeah!" Madoka agrees. "And I can look at baby clothes for Tatsuya there, too."

"Are you looking for a suit or a dress, Sabrina?" Mami asks. "Ah... this way."

"Um..." You tap your chin thoughtfully as you walk arm-in-arm with Mami, your other friends following. "I thiiiink a suit? I think suits suit me better."

"You would look great whatever you choose, I'm sure," Mami says.

"Nah, Sabrina's right," Sayaka says. "She's *definitely* a suit kind of girl."

"I think Sabrina would look good in a dress too!" Madoka says.

"Sure, but I mean... look at her, she's one hundred percent a suit person," Sayaka says, waving vaguely in your direction.

"That's true..." Madoka says. "What do you think, Homura?"

"... I don't know?" Homura says, looking vaguely hunted.

"Awww." Madoka pouts.

"Nagisa thinks big sis should wear a dress!" Nagisa says.

"This still isn't necessary for meeting my parents," Hitomi says. "That said... mm. What kind of suit did you have in mind, Sabrina?"

"Maybe not a standard two-piece suit," you say. "I was thinking a vest suit?"

"Mmm... I could certainly see that," Hitomi says, considering you.

"That would look *great* on you," Mami says, eyes brightening as she looks you up and down. "With a tie?"

"A bowtie?" you say. "Bowties are cool."

"No, they're not," Sayaka says, smacking you lightly on the back of your head. "And if you say *one word* about fezzes, I'm going home."

"I'm sure I don't know what you mean," you say, grinning.

"I'm *sure*," Hitomi adds dryly. "Now, if we're looking for a suit vest, we're almost certainly not going to find anything proper in a department store, but I suppose we'll still take a look. Over there?"

Hitomi turns out to be mostly right. You *do* find a few vests, but all made in adult sizes, and not of any style that really appeals to you. Instead, you turn your attention to helping Madoka pick out baby clothes for Tatsuya, several soft, brightly coloured sets joining the socks in her basket, and while you're doing that, you keep an eye on Nagisa -currently bouncing around the store and admiring all the clothes on the mannequins- and on Homura.

"Sooooo," Sayaka says, sidling over to Homura while Hitomi closes off her other flank. "About getting new clothes for you."

"There is nothing wrong with my clothes," Homura says. She almost sounds *pouty*.

You exchange a look with Mami, who's joined you in rummaging through a stack of baby overalls. She hides her grin, but she can't disguise the way her eyes crinkle up in mirth.

You stifle a giggle.

"Sure, but it could be *better*," Sayaka says. "Don't you think so, Madoka?"

"Ah?" Madoka looks up from the stack.

"Don't you think Homura would look better in... hmm, actually, I'm kind of surprised you're not wearing jeans, Homura," Sayaka says. "Or pants like Sabrina does. It'd suit you pretty well."

Homura shrugs.

"Skinny jeans *would* suit Homura very well," Hitomi muses.

"... I have jeans at home," Homura says.

"Hunh. Well, fine," Sayaka says. "You should think about wearin' em sometime - seriously, I reckon they fit your style."

Homura shrugs again, looking relieved that Sayaka's backing off. You finish up with the department store, Madoka happy with her purchases while you grab some a light makeup kit for yourself on the way out, along with some shampoo and conditioner. Maybe that'll actually help neaten your hair up a bit.

And from there, Hitomi directs you to one of the boutiques - which she *assures* you is reasonably priced. Even with your Homura-aided yakuza raids, there's a limit on how much money you can reasonably spend at once.

It doesn't take more than a few questions and answers before the saleswoman loads down your arms with a few different sets and ushers you off to the changing room.

When you emerge, you're wearing a trim, figure-hugging vest over a collared shirt; a deep, navy blue over soft lavender. Just two buttons on the vest, with *pockets* and vertical pinstripes to emphasize your height, and paired with narrow-cut trousers of a matching blue.

You turn to your friends, all sitting on the waiting bench outside the dressing rooms, and smile perhaps a touch shyly. "Well?"

Sayaka whistles.

"That's super cool!" Nagisa says, clapping her hands happily. "You look like Uncle Shin when he goes off to do his business stuff!"

Mami looks you up and down, smiling warm and *very* approving. "You look *fantastic*, Sabrina."

"Thank you, everyone," you say, beaming, but you save your best smile for Mami. "It even has pockets! Though I think... mm, Miss Amano-" you turn to the saleswoman "-do you have any ties you could recommend? I was thinking gold, or gold-ish?"

"Not pure gold," Hitomi adds.

"A pale gold, perhaps? Or gold-patterned?" the saleswoman offers.

"Something like that?" you say with a sheepish grin.

She nods, and when she returns with a handful of ties, only to be intercepted on her return. Mami thumbs through the ties, selecting a dark tie streaked with bands of gold, and walks over to you with an expectant smile.

You beam, and let her knot the tie around your neck for you.

"Perfect," she says, stepping back and smiling.

You blush.

"I assume you're referring to the outfit," you say. "Thank you, Mami."

Mami doesn't say anything, simply raising her eyebrow at you, and you blush a little more.

"Alright, alright, break it up you two," Sayaka says, rolling her eyes and ignoring Madoka's elbow in her side. "Sabrina, that looks damn good but don't just go and buy the first thing you try on. Check the rest out too."

You huff in exasperation, but Mami just smiles and returns to her seat, arranging her hands primly on her lap. Which you take to mean that yes, you *are* going to be trying on the rest of the outfits, too, but she thinks -and you agree!- that this one's probably the best you'll find.

And as it turns out, it is. It's not cheap, but you pay for it gladly - you're certain it will serve you well.

Mami reclaims your arm as you walk out, bags in hand.

"*Heeeeey. Miss Sabrina? Do you have a sec?*" It takes you a moment to place the voice - Nakano Mika, over in Ishinomaki. You're pretty sure she's the heir of Nakano corporation, and... hah, now that you think about it, she's probably the reason Shin's seeing more interest in Mitakihara. You *did* mention Walpurgisnacht to her.

"*Miss Mika? Sure, what's happening?*" you ask. Mami glances your way, a questioning look in her eyes. You shrug, wobbling a hand from side to side.

"*Did you girls pick up a weather girl at some point?*" Mika asks.

"*... no, why?*" you say slowly. Mami tightens her arm on yours, apparently picking up on your tension.

"*That storm sitting on top of you guys is pretty neat,*" Mika says. "*And I *was* wondering if I could come over and take a look at it? But uh, if you don't know anything about it...*"

"*No, I don't,*" you say. Homura's eyes flicker over to you for a moment, and you can't help but notice the way she drifts back a step, gaze suddenly sharp and watchful. "*It's not a natural storm?*"

"*No, no, it is,*" Mika says. "*Uh, well, it started out naturally, rolled right in from the sea and everything. But now\... I don't think it's *completely* natural?*"

"*Can you tell me anything more?*" you ask.

"*I don't think it's harmful or anything? Just that the storm *should* be slackening off by now, but isn't,*" Mika says apologetically. "*Sorry, that's as much as I can tell you without heading over.*"

# A Red Letter Day pt. 23

It's very *good* green tea. You sip at it slowly, savouring the fragrance. "How've you been, Oriko?" you ask.

"I am doing better," she allows. "The pain has faded away, but my visions... haven't returned."

"Yet. I hope?" you say. You're not sure if you should be hoping for that, really.

Oriko smiles, thin and razor-sharp. "As you noted last time, Sabrina, it may be that I don't need them," she says. "I have *some* magic, and I have Kirika."

Kirika makes a pleased, cat-like noise, and presses closer to Oriko.

"Granted, but not needing it isn't the same as being denied it," you say, leaning back and bumping shoulders against Mami. She smiles at you.

Oriko inclines her head towards you, acknowledging the point.

You smile, setting the cup of tea down so that you can take Mami's hand and interlacing your fingers. "Is there anything in particular you need, by the way? I got some general groceries for you, but anything specific?"

"Baking supplies would be welcome," Oriko murmurs.

"Hm... I know I bought flour and eggs and such," you muse. "Do you have sugar and shortening and such?"

"We do, yes," Oriko agrees, raising her eyebrows in mild, aristocratically understated surprise. "That's perfect, thank you."

"I aim to please." You grin at her, receiving a faint, amused smile in response. "How 'bout you, Kirika? Anything you need?"

"Nah, I've got everything I need," Kirika says, winking at you.

"Oh, right-" you say, pointing your finger at her. "Remember I asked you about Kuroki Matsuko, right?"

"Hm?" Kirika says, cocking her head. "Oh, her. The girl you asked me to doxx."

"Yeah, her," you say. "Just thought you'd appreciate an update - I went and looked for her, based on a lead. She went out to the old industrial district, and, uh, had a tantrum, by the looks of it. And then she upped and vanished into thin air."

"Huh," Kirika says, blinking. "Witch?"

"Maybe. Witch, or maybe a Wish," you agree, and give Mami a warm smile. "That was Mami's idea, though. Maybe she had someone who really cared about her - friend, sister, or whatever was worried about her and made a Wish for her?"

Kirika clasps her hands, eyes almost sparkling. "That's so romantic!" she squeals, before wrinkling her nose. "Well, not if it's her sister. That would be ew if it was romantic. But still a very sweet thing to do."

"Does she *have* a sister?" you ask, raising your eyebrows. "I didn't see that in the print out."

"Nah, but not everyone uses Facebook, y'know," Kirika says, smirking. "Oriko doesn't. *Maybe* she has a girlfriend?"

"Well..." you say. "She *did* go to a Catholic school. Where she was bullied."

Kirika shrugs. "Maybe?"

"Perhaps whatever entity is responsible for..." Oriko glances at you.

You blow out a quiet sigh. "Alright, I suppose the small talk's over," you say, stretching your hand out to the side as you make a tiny effort of will. "Give me a moment to create a privacy device, if you don't mind?"

"By all means," Oriko agrees.

You catch the blob of Grief that sails in through the open window, giving Mami a warm smile. She looks at you with wide, trusting eyes, and nods before ducking her head and tucking herself against your side. You bring the Grief in front of you, and you *focus*.

It's a *familiar* pattern at this point, a twist of your mind just *so*. You impress your will on the Grief, moulding it along practiced lines as the dark purple mass runs like hot wax, flowing into a different shape entirely. A green circlet set with a single golden jewel, mounted on a pedestal.

Mami shifts and smiles at you as you lean forward to set the privacy construct on the table. "Seven minutes," she says, showing you the screen of her phone.

"Hm, a bit of variance, then," you say thoughtfully. Oriko eyes the construct - it *can* be a bit distracting, you suppose, but you're well used to the constant press of *Witch*. Mami's right - you *can* tell.

Then again, Mami often *is* right.

"Are we free to speak?" Oriko asks.

"Yep," you say, motioning at the little circle, and then gesturing at the hazy view outside your little bubble of privacy. "A little cloistered space, free of *any* kind of eavesdropping."

Oriko nods. "Then... might it have been whatever force caused the Witch to attack Miki Sayaka early."

Mami frowns at Oriko. "Please explain, Miss Mikuni?"

"Has Miss Sabrina told you about the... feathers that interfered with my visions?" Oriko asks. Both you and Mami nod in near unison. "I foresaw that Miki Sayaka could have been attacked by a Witch. It did not happen as my vision dictated. It was simply too early, and she was in the wrong place."

"The... the black and white Witch?" Mami asks, glancing to you for confirmation.

"Yeah," you say.

"There are- two entities that can defy my visions," Oriko says. "The first is Miss Sabrina. The second is whatever this thing is that shrouded my visions. And it having demonstrated the ability to simply *move* Miss Miki, I... suggest it might be related to the disappearance of Miss Kuroki?"

"That's... possible," you say, nodding slowly. "I... yeah. I can see that. It's a lot more, uh, *concrete* than my idea, which is that someone might have snatched her with portal or teleportation or flight or something - problem with that is that there's no *motive*."

"It's not that bad," Mami disagrees. "It's possible."

"Possible but not plausible," you say, smiling at her and squeezing her hand. "I like your idea much better. And Oriko's suggestion is quite possible, too."

"'course it is," Kirika says loyally, grinning at Oriko and cuddling against her.

"Though, uh, speaking of flight and kidnapping people..." you squeeze Mami's hand with your interlaced fingers. "Actually, hang on a sec. Would it be alright if I invited Homura here? I think she should be involved in this discussion. Uh. To clarify, she's not related to the flight and kidnapping people, I just remembered that I should call her."

"You want to call *her* here?" Kirika scowls at you, but immediately subsides when Oriko puts a hand on her elbow.

"Do you think it would be *helpful*?" Oriko asks, eyes narrowing.

"I think that it'll create more trouble if she *isn't* in this conversation with us," you say slowly. "Communication is important."

"And you can't update her afterwards?" Oriko asks, eyes sharp.

"No," you say. "It's a discussion."

Oriko grimaces. "Then call her."

"Alright. Thanks, Oriko," you say, rising to your feet. Mami smiles at you, warm and adoring.

To your faint surprise, Oriko follows you beyond the hazy boundary of the private space. "I will prepare tea for her, too," she murmurs, brushing down silvery-grey hair with her one hand.

"Do you think she'd *drink* it?" you ask, raising an eyebrow at her.

"I don't," Oriko says, shrugging and padding over the rug floor to the kitchen. "But I will make the offer, nevertheless. It behooves a host to do so."

"Alright," you say, giving her a skeptical look. You put that aside, and turn your attention to *calling* your friend. "*Homura?*"

"*Yes?*" She responds near instantly, somehow giving the impression of coming fully alert in an instant.

"*Mami and I are at Oriko's house - and before you worry, nothing bad's happening,*" you say. "*But. I want to discuss going to Asunaro. Would you like to be in the conversation with us? If you have the time? I'd value your opinion on this, because I'll be out of the city for a while. And...*"

Homura's silent for a long moment. "*I will be there in a few minutes.*"

"*Alright,*" you say. "*Thanks, Homura. See you soon. Uh, just a heads up, I put up a privacy field, so be aware of the Witchy sensation. But, um, grab me for a quick conversation when you arrive?*"

"*Noted,*" she says, and cuts the connection.

You wait outside the bubble, rocking back and forth on the balls of your feet and waving happily at the void black bubble that is your privacy field. You can't see in, but the way you made it, you *know* Mami can see out, and you're sure she's looking your way. Oriko raises an aristocratically amused eyebrow at you as she passes you on the way back with another fine porcelain cup in her hand. You stick your tongue out at her.

Homura's as good as her word - it's only a few minutes later when you feel the world *stutter* to the lifeless, monochrome colours of timestop. Warm fingers against your wrist would be Homura's hand.

You smile at her. "Hey, Homura. Thanks for coming," you say.

She nods shortly, amethyst eyes glancing past you to the boundary of your privacy field. "They're in there?" she asks, clipped and sharp.

"Yeah," you say. "I- OK, Homura, I'm going to put this simply. I don't know whether *you* would have come across it during your time travel, but I have reason to believe that the girls from Asunaro, managed to create a partial method of de-Witching. It wasn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot closer than anything I know of."

"I... see," Homura says. She seems taken aback for once, eyes slightly widened and lips parted just a hair. "That is... that would be..."

"Yeah," you say. "And, um, the other thing I want to learn from them if it's at all possible is that they created an anti-Kyuubey field. They managed to make it so that nobody in their entire city could see or even *remember* Kyuubey's existence."

Homura sucks in a sharp breath, and this time, you can all but see the gears turning in her head. "I-"

"Yeah," you say, nodding. "Um, just to bring you up to speed, since I'm guessing you never went over there, Mami's ex-student, Michiru Kazusa, is the leader of the girls over there, the Pleiades Saints. She's due to Witch out, which sets off a whole chain of events that results in the developments of, um, the two pieces of magic I mentioned."

Homura nods again, wordless but attention locked on to you. You can see her making the connections in her head, the pieces slotting together. "You are sure?"

You wobble your hand from side to side. "Yeeeees, but there are, uh, complications I want to bring everyone up to speed on. Shall we?"

"Yes," she says, purple eyes intent. You feel her fingers loosening around yours as she steps back, and the world-

\-*shudders* back into vibrant colour and *noise*. You suck in a breath, and wave at Homura as if she'd just appeared in front of you. "Hey, Homura. Shall we?"

She nods once more, and follows you into the bubble. You settle down on the sofa beside Mami, who takes the opportunity to cuddle up against you. Homura sits on your other side, shifting uneasily away from the other couple.

Oriko inclines her head regally. "Miss Akemi," she says, and pushes a freshly poured cup of green tea towards her.

Homura ignores her, of course. Or perhaps not exactly *ignore*. The muscles of her shoulder and neck are corded tight as steel cable, her attention zeroed in on Oriko with the intense focus of a sniper rifle's scope. Said attention lingers for a fraction longer on the smooth, rounded stump of Oriko's injured arm.

You sigh as Mami takes your hand, twining your fingers together. You smile at her, squeezing gently. "So, um... now that we're all here, I..." you lick your lips, suddenly a little nervous about telling *Mami*. "I plan on going to Asunaro sometime soon."

You watch Oriko's placidly blank expression *twitch* with surprise, and then slide into confusion, and then confused annoyance.

Truth be told, you kind of enjoy seeing Oriko like that. It's kind of amusing. The majority of your attention, though is on Mami. You're already pulling her into a hug as her smile fades. She's not stupid, and she can make the connection to her old student.

"I-" her voice shakes a little, even muffled by your shirt. "I'm- I'm alright, Sabrina." She pulls away with just the tiniest bit of force, and you let her retreat to face everyone, expression troubled, but resolute. You keep your arm around her, keeping her close by your side.

"Asunaro is the home of Kazusa Michiru," Mami says in a voice the only trembles slightly. "A... a past student of mine."

You nod, and squeeze her hand in silent support.

"We... we parted on good terms," she says. "But she- she couldn't leave her home, and she had her own team to look after. I- we haven't kept in contact."

Because it was too painful to stay in touch for her. You can read between the lines well enough.

You smile proudly at her, brushing her hair back from where you'd disturbed it. "Yeah," you say with a quiet sigh. "That's... what I thought. Thank you, Mami."

"Why do you wish to go?" Oriko asks. Kirika seems interested, attention darting between you and Mami, and Homura might as well be a statue for all she's moving.

"I also know of the Asunaro girls," you say. "Or rather, I *know* of them. I am fairly certain that they *will* develop techniques that are very useful to us, and... I know that they're going to be in trouble soon."

You can feel the frission of shock that jolts through Mami's body, her attention turning to you.

"That's why I want to go," you say, giving Mami a reassuring smile. "I don't want anything to happen to them, either. But there *is* one catch - my knowledge so far has been quite accurate. Not necessarily *complete*, but accurate."

Oriko frowns sharply. "Not in this case?" she asks, leaning forward to top up your cup of green tea.

"Not quite," you say. "What I *know* is that Miss Kazusa was someone who *met* Mami in passing. Not her *student*."

"B-but that's not right," Mami says, shaking her head.

"Yeah," you say, slumping. You *have* to be careful here. You can't let Mami know about Michiru's Witching out, even though that's a key part of why you're going. Thankfully, you've got both Homura *and* Oriko to help guide the conversation. "To be honest... my *knowledge* of them is slightly suspect. I'm certain of the broad strokes of things, but specifics are questionable."

"I see," Oriko says, placing her palm flat on her lap. "And you choose to go despite my... warning?"

*That* gets Homura's attention. You'd guessed it would.

"Oriko, no offense, but you *know* my opinion on relying on your visions," you point out. Your lips quirk in amusement. "And besides, as you said: I defy them."

"None taken, and a fair point," Oriko allows.

"What was this warning?" Homura asks, voice tight.

"Just that, Miss Akemi," Oriko says. "I recommended that Miss Sabrina not go to Asunaro, due to the fact that based on what I saw, it is *very* messy."

"About that," you say, leaning forward. "I *would* like to know what happens there."

"Truth be told, it is hard to make sense of it, with my powers faded," Oriko says. "Your biggest foes there are Kanna Hijiri, Airi Anri and Jyuubey, should it come into existence. Do you know of them?"

"I do," you agree. "But wait, Jyuubey?"

"Jyuubey is a fake Incubator the Pleiades create as an attempt to replace Kyuubey," Oriko says, frowning.

Mami's sharp intake of breath doesn't slip past you. You smile at her, hugging her tightly. She quails, shrinking a little and pressing closer to you. "I'm- fine," she whispers, voice husky. "I'm fine."

"Alright," you whisper, but don't loosen your hug. "No, I know that, Oriko. Why would *Jyuubey* be my enemy? Though hopefully events don't even *get* to that point. And I need to know what *you* saw, because I need to try and compare."

"I am uncertain," Oriko says, frowning and rubbing at her temple. "It is emotional, and you are at odds with it." She sighs. "I apologise. I cannot see any clearer than that."

"Alright," you say. "The others?"

"Kanna Hijiri is a... mentally unstable girl," Oriko says. "I... I think she was created by a Wish? She is violent and resentful, and ruthlessly against the Pleiades Saints. She's able to flawlessly connect and synthesize other magical girl's abilities, and manipulates Airi into doing her bidding."

You nod, turning that over in your head. "That matches what I know," you agree. Unspoken is the caveat that what you *know* of them are their actions *after* Kazusa Witches out. "What are Airi's powers?"

"She summons ranged weapons," Oriko says. "Or creates them, I am uncertain."

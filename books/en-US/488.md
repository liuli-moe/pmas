# On a Rail pt. 5

You take another bite of the scone, making a happy noise. Freshly baked scone, literally right out of the oven and still steaming. All but perfect.

You find Mami watching you with a smile. An answering smile, warm and contented, rises to your lips.

"It really is wonderful, you know," you murmur, lowering the scone a little. "Just... Your cooking, and *you*." You shake your head, smiling a little. "I wouldn't change it for the world."

Heh. What could have been, way back then. You might have chosen to go with Homura, and things would have been *different*. Would you still have become such close friends with Mami? You have no idea, and you're not absolutely sure you like the notion.

Mami blushes a little, putting the scone down and fiddling with it. "T-thank you, Sabrina."

"No need to thank me for telling the truth, Mami," you say, reaching across the table to pat her hand. "I mean it. Every word of it."

"I..." Mami looks up, meeting your eyes for a moment before glancing down at the scone again. "So do I, Sabrina. Thank you for s-staying."

"I did promise," you say, nudging her to turn her hand over so that you're palm to palm. "Now, shall we finish up? While the scones are still hot?"

"Ah... Yes," Mami says, ducking her head and smiling little.

You eat in a comfortable silence, the Grief instruments long stowed. Between the two of you, you demolish the pile of freshly baked pastries, just in time for the baking timer to let out a cheerful ding.

You hop to your feet. Mami's already headed to the oven, so you grab the breakfast utensils, moving them to the sink and hurrying after her. You get there just in time for Mami to pull open the oven door, releasing a huge cloud of fragrant steam.

Mami sighs happily as she withdraws a baking pan from the oven with gleaming golden oven mitts, bringing it over to the counter. Grief flows in the window as you follow her example with oven mitts, and you hurry after her to grab the second one. She flashes you a smile as she passes you on the way to grab the third and last one.

Hey, when you're baking for friends, why not go fancy with a nice, three layered cake?

"Ah, where's the cream?" Mami asks, looking around.

"Got it," you say, dismissing your oven mitts out of the window and grabbing the cream. "Anyway, Mami," you say as you start laying out the rest of the ingredients for the frosting. "I was thinking we could plan out the morning while we do this?"

"Umm..." Mami spreads the cake tins out on the cooling rack. "These will need fifteen minutes to cool, so..."

"Ooh, right," you say, walking to stand beside her and hug her around the waist. You're careful not to disturb her fussing with the cakes. "Anyway, so... Today, first thing is the cooking, of course. We finish the baking and cooking now, right?"

"We can make most of the preparations now," Mami notes. "But, um, we'll need two hours, uh, one hour before the picnic itself for more cooking? U-uh," she starts to worry at her lower lip with one hand, tugging anxiously at it. "M-maybe we could try and do more now, but-"

"That's fine," you say with a smile. "Mami, I didn't mean it that way." You capture her hand, bringing it away from her mouth and down to her waist. "It's fine."

"A-alright," Mami agrees.

You hug her for a little while longer, nestling your chin comfortably in the crook of her neck. She calms down slowly, the tension bleeding out of her frame as she nestles back against you.

"S-so, um." She interrupts the silence. "What else do we need to do?"

"Hm," you say thoughtfully. "Well, let's see. Training for Sayaka; I mentioned that yesterday. Training and or Experimenting time for me, with you. We should probably check in with everyone too, make sure they're coming. And Nagisa's uncle, too. Hmm... I kind of want to check in on Oriko and Kirika, too, see what Oriko's condition is like and whether they're behaving. Maybe bring them some pastries?"

"Um..." Mami says. "How long will you want to visit our... prisoners?"

"Half an hour?" you say, frowning. "Maybe?"

"W-well, we should have plenty of time?" Mami says. "We do what we can of the cooking and baking now, then we can spend an hour or two working on your powers? And then we can call everyone, and tell Sayaka to come over for a while, and then just after that, we check on Mikuni?"

Your eyes flare wide at the mention of Sayaka, alarm bells going off inside your head. Now that you think about it - you *didn't* tell her about the interaction between the clear Seed and normal ones. And she *does* have both of them and-

"Sabrina? Sabrina, what's wrong?" Mami asks.

"No, I-" you start to breathe fast and hard. A tightly wound frisson of *fear* trickles down your back. "I didn't warn Sayaka about clear Seeds, remember when I nearly hatched a Grief Seed on me? I, I what if it already hatched on Sayaka-"

"I-I-" Mami stutters. Your panic is infectious, her eyes widening as she stiffens in your arms. "I- she would have called us if something happened, right?"

"Except we went to sleep early, I-" you shake your head, bile surging in your throat. "But Homura was there, she would have taken care of it, Sayaka would be- I have to warn her-" You switch to telepathy. "*Sayaka. Sayaka!*"

She doesn't respond immediately. Your heart lurches in your chest as Mami turns to hug *you* tightly. "I'm sure she's fine," she mumbles. "They would have called us otherwise."

"I-" you clamp down on the initial panic and force yourself to *think*. *Surely* Sayaka would have contacted you, if not her, then Madoka or Homura. And Homura was there, of course, and she would have taken care of any Witch that so much as dared to *exist* near Madoka.

"*What do you want.*" Sayaka's sleepy, *grumpy* voice echoes inside your head. "*It's six thirty on a *Saturday*.*"

You relax, slumping forward against Mami in sheer relief. "She's OK," you mumble to her. She nods, tucking her head under your chin and tightening the hug.

"*Oh, I-*" you say, shaking yourself. "*The clear Seed I gave you - Uh. I forgot to tell you something very important - *do not* put the clear Seed and a normal Grief Seed together.*"

"*... I'm going back to sleep,*" Sayaka *growls* at you.

"*I-*" You need to explain to her *why*, but she cuts you off.

"*Good*night*, Sabrina,*" she grunts, and cuts you off.

You sag against Mami. "W-well. She's fine," you say, voice shaky with relief.

"That's good," Mami says.

You let a shuddering breath out, and just... relax for a minute. When you start contemplating serenading Mami again with the full lyrics of [Mirai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljC0dU53CQ), you shake yourself. Not...

Not... yet?

A thought for later.

"A-anyway," you say, clearing your throat. "Is there anything *you* want to do today, Mami? Our schedule is... reasonably clear, today. And, um... I've kind of messed up your studies last week. Is there anything you have to do from school?"

Mami shifts to look at you, lips parting slightly. "A-ah," she says after a moment of thought. "Um. I just want to spend time with you, so... anything is alright. Though... I *do* have some homework, if we have time tonight? After the picnic?"

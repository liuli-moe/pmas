# Office Complex pt. 33

"Kyouko..." Mami trails off, uncertain and more than a little lost. She presses her lips together, tears forgotten as she blinks at Kyouko. You can feel the Grief in her Soul Gem, and in Kyouko's, darkness simmering away slowly. Your own, too.

You take a jerky step forward, mouth opening to say something, but-

What?

How do you interject?

You realise, as the thoughts sleet through your head, that you'd never told Mami the full story, either. But this-

*This isn't your fight*.

You could say something. You could lay out the details, the same sad story that you'd never gotten around to telling Mami about. But not *now*. You dart a glance at Sayaka and Homura, the latter impassive and the former conflicted, anger duelling incomprehension across her face. You're not sure Kyouko would appreciate you laying bare her secrets and her shame to others.

You shoot Mami a quick look, taking in the way her head is still high despite the way her hands are shaking a bit, and you can't help the surge of pride. Maybe some of it shows on your face when she glances over at you, because she manages to straighten a little before refocusing on Kyouko, seeming to find strength anew.

You freeze in your tracks, words dying unspoken on your lips. Not now. You have to trust Mami.

Kyouko looks down, her eyes shaded by her hair. But there's enough life in her to glance your way, lips peeling off her teeth into that sneer of hers, all false bravado and fragile confidence. But as she opens her mouth to speak again, Mami interrupts.

"Kyouko," she says, soft and resolute. "I don't understand why you're doing this. Please help me understand?"

"Haaah..." Kyouko says, hooking both arms behind her head again and looking up at the night sky. "I dunno. Got no idea why I'm here."

Mami exhales quietly. Her gaze turns to you, and you smile at her even as you slouch back against the wall along the sides of the bridge - because Mami's doing great, even if *you* are hesitant and uncertain. You've put your trust on Mami, because she deserves it, and you hope that she knows.

"I don't believe that," Mami says at last. "I think you came here for a reason, Kyouko, even if you can't spit it out." She shakes her head. "You really haven't changed from that same old troublesome student of mine."

"I'm *not* your student any more," Kyouko snarls, eyes flashing.

"Maybe not," Mami says. "But you're..." She smiles, tremulous. "You're still my friend, Kyouko."

"Still *naive*," Kyouko spits. "There's no place for that, Mami-*sempai*. How many people left you, huh? Ten? Twenty?"

Brief flashes of pain spark up your arms, your fingers digging into the soft flesh of your palm and your jaw creaking as you force yourself to stay silent.

"Two less than it could be," Mami says, seemingly unfazed other than closing her eyes for a second. "Three less. Kyouko, I... I don't know what happened. But I *know* that it wasn't your fault."

"*I killed my family*," Kyouko snarls. "I don't *deserve* your kindness."

And there it is.

"Did you?" Mami asks. "Because I don't believe that." She tilts her head slightly and smiles at you. "Did she?"

And that-

-it's like a knot of tension comes apart in an instant, leaving you breathless for a second. Not just that you get to *say* something, the million and one thoughts spilling over into the paralysis of decision, but also that Mami isn't taking it all upon herself. She's not alone.

"No," you say. "No, she didn't."

"What the hell do *you* know?" Kyouko rounds on you, all sharp angles and harsh shadows.

"Enough," you say. "Kyouko..." You sigh, pushing off the wall, and take a step forward. You catch Mami's eye. "I *know*. Do you want me to share? I can get everyone on the same page, and I guarantee you everyone will listen, and tell you the same thing, Kyouko. It wasn't your fault."

"I-" Kyouko's hands fist at her side, visibly restraining herself.

"Not now, I think," Mami says. She smiles at you, brief and wan, before turning her attention back to Kyouko. "It seems, Kyouko, that you're not a bad person. I don't think a bad person would have taken in Yuma, either, no matter how much you protest, so... Kyouko, the only person who seems to hate you is yourself."

"Yeah? So what?" Kyouko says. "So *what* if you think that?!"

"Oh, come off it," Sayaka grumbles, not *quite* under her breath.

"Come out of the cold, Kyouko," Mami offers. "I... I don't believe for a second that you're a bad person, however much you pretend you are. You may have done things that you regret, but... if *I'm* naive for believing in justice, that things can be made *right*, I remember a girl who thought the same."

"Come out of the cold?" Kyouko snarls, fire returning. "Th' hell does *that* mean?"

"We've got a spare room," Mami says. She holds her open hand out to Kyouko, and despite the tremble in her arm, despite the Grief you can feel churning in her Soul Gem, she's smiling. "I never hated you, Kyouko. And we're talking now, right? I... I guess we've still got things to resolve, but you can stay the night?"

"I..." Kyouko's jaw twitches, clenched together tight enough that you imagine you can hear her teeth creaking against each other.

"Bring Yuma, too, of course," Mami says, lowering her hand. "There's enough room for the both of you."

"I'll think about it." Kyouko whispers the words, half turning away. "I'll think about it."

Without a look back, she strides away, ponytail swishing behind her.

"... *oi*!" Sayaka yells after her, her frustration apparently finally boiling over. "You *better* not be skipping out on us. I'll hunt you down and kick your ass myself!"

Kyouko's only response is a rude gesture over her shoulder.

"Let her go," Mami murmurs to you, eyes fixed on Kyouko's disappearing form. "She... she was always like that." She turns to you, eyes glistening with tears. "I... she'll come by. I know she will. I *know* she will."

"I believe you," you murmur, smiling at her and holding your arms out. "You were *amazing*, Mami."

She nods, taking a teetering step towards you... and collapses into your arms, shaking with adrenaline and sheer, pent up *emotion*. She buries her face against your shoulder, clinging to you as though to a float in a storm, and you're not sure where *her* trembles end and yours begin as the tension finally breaks.

"*Dumbass*," Sayaka mutters, running an unsteady hand through her hair. "God. I just *stood* there and I'm..."

"That... went well," Homura says quietly. She seems the least affected, a seemingly emotionless statue, gaze fixed on the road and hooded by shadow. "Well done, Mami."

"I- I-" Mami shakes her head, words muffled by your shirt. "I put a ribbon on her. Just in case. But she- but she'll come. I know she will."

"You-" You can't help the startled laugh that bubbles up your throat. You hadn't even *noticed* it, Grief senses and all. "That's my Mami."

"I... let's go home, Sabrina," she says softly.

"Yeah, I gotta get going back to Madoka's, too," Sayaka says, making a face. "Still got homework to do. *And* I've got some thinking to do. This day's been *way* too long."

"May I join you?" Homura murmurs.

Sayaka snorts, rolling her eyes. "Ask Madoka when you get there, and she'll say yes," she says. "So... yeah, c'mon."

So, honestly, any of the three (Let Mami handle it, Kaizuki's, or Godwinson's) options would have been qualified successes, just to various degrees. I'm not going which ones were which, but one of them would have resulted in a lot more belligerence. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# This mortal coil pt. 23

You push your chair back, raising your eyebrows at Mami. She shakes her head, tilting her head at the duo around the bed - Sayaka and Hitomi, both staring as violin boy fiddles with his instrument.

"*Mami?*" you ask via telepathy, glancing aside at her.

"*Yes, Sabrina?*" she responds, turning to smile at you.

"*Well...*" you say as the first strains of music fill the air. Simple scales, a running series of notes. "*Um, do you remember that I mentioned Oriko needs help?*"

"*Ah... yes.*" Mami's smile fades a little.

"*Yeah,*" you say, rubbing uncomfortably at your mouth. You're... a *little* leery of bringing it up like this, but... Oriko and Kirika. You consider them friends, you think. And they're *people*, regardless - so they're worth your help.

After a short pause to let Mami mull it over, you continue. "*I was thinking we could go over now? If that's OK with you? Kirika's been waiting for the whole day...*"

The first strains of music, actual music, fill the air as Mami worries at her lip. "*It... if you think that's best, Sabrina,*" she says. "*What about dinner?*"

"*Ah... they have food, too,*" you say. You hadn't really thought about it, but it's that or order in, you suppose.

Mami nods. "*Ah, that makes sense,*" she says, essaying a weak smile.

"*Are you OK with this, Mami?*" you ask, reaching over to lay your hand over Mami's.

She nods, smile becoming a little stronger. "*Just a little disappointed,*" she admits. "*It would have been nice to cook for everyone again.*"

"*Hey, there's still the picnic,*" you say, squeezing Mami's hand in reassurance. "*And many more days to come after that.*"

She exhales, turning her hand over so that she can grip your hand, squeezing lightly. "*Alright,*" she says, voice soft. "*Shall we go, then?*"

"*After he finishes, maybe?*" you suggest, tilting your head at Kyousuke and his enraptured audience. He's playing Ave Maria, swaying back and forth on the bed with his eyes closed.

Madoka looks *delighted*, a bright smile on her face as she looks around. She catches your eye and beams happily, turning her eyes to Hitomi and Sayaka who look utterly captivated.

Homura... is Homura, standing stolidly next to Madoka with an utterly neutral mask on her face.

You sigh quietly as you listen to Kyousuke play. He's good, you have to admit. *Very* good, if this is what he plays like months out of practice.

He keeps his eyes closed as the piece comes to an end, silence sweeping in like a soft, velvet curtain. Slow tears glimmer at the corner of his eyes, his lips upturned into a faint smile.

You break the silence. "Hey, guys? Mami and I need to head off now," you say, keeping your voice quiet.

"Eh?" Madoka asks, blinking at you in surprise. Homura glances at you, amethyst eyes neutral.

"Yeah... something else to handle," you say, nodding slowly.

"Ah... thanks, Sabrina," Sayaka says. "For being here."

"Eh," you say, waving it off.

Kyousuke opens his eyes, looking up at you. "Ah, you're leaving?" he asks. He bows slightly at the waist. "Thank you both for... for giving me back my music. And you too, Sayaka."

The bleunette blushes slightly. "Just doing my job," she says, trying to downplay it. "Magical girls help people, you know?"

"Anyway," you say, standing. "One round of cleansing, everyone?"

Sayaka glances down at the ring on her hand. "Oh, yeah," she says. "Uh, right." Holding her hand out, her Soul Gem manifests with a shimmer of blue.

Mami presents her Soul Gem to you too, as does Homura, and you cleanse it all with a careless crook of your finger - your own, too. You spin the Grief into a few small marbles, sending them coasting out of the window to join the main mass on the rooftops.

Which is really a *huge* amount, honestly... The only real reason you wanted so much was for making Barriers, and with that on hold... Even MECHA GURREN ZILLA LAGANN didn't take *that* much Grief.

Eh. It'll wait.

"Thanks, Sabrina," Sayaka says.

"No problem," you say, waving it off. "Anyway... I guess Mami and I will be going now?"

"Bye, Sabrina, Mami!" Madoka says, waving. "See you tomorrow!"

"Yeah, see you tomorrow," Sayaka agrees.

Hitomi smiles at you, nodding slightly. "Thank you, and see you tomorrow."

Homura exhales slowly. "See you," she says. Mind to mind, she adds a quiet, "*Be careful.*"

"*Yeah,*" you agree. "*I remember, Homura. I will.*"

Homura nods slightly as you and Mami leave the room.

You smile at Mami, motioning down the corridor. She lifts her arms a little, palms out. You smile, and oblige her with a hug. "I'm sorry, Mami."

She shakes her head, the golden driils of her hair brushing against you. "No," she says. "It makes sense. If Oriko is in need... Then we *should* take care of her."

"Yeah," you agree. And speaking of taking care of people, that reminds you of something. You open up a connection to Homura again, as you separate from the hug and start down the corridor, Mami walking at your side. "*Hey. Homura?*"

"*Yes?*" the time traveller responds.

"*I forgot to bring this up earlier,*" you say as you wait for the lift, humming tonelessly to yourself. "*But um, could you lend Sayaka a Grief Seed? I would give her the one I have myself, but uh, I think there may be problems with it.*"

"*I can offer,*" Homura says, a note of... something in her voice. "*She may not take it.*"

You exhale slowly. "*I think she will. She actually kind of respects you, you know?*"

Silence from Homura, as the lift arrives and you step into it.

You're reaching the first floor and about to prompt Homura when she speaks again. "*She took it,*" Homura says, sounding faintly surprised.

"*Thank you, Homura,*" you say, smiling a little as you step out into the waning evening light.

Silence again. Mami and you head down an alley, leaping up towards the rooftops once you're out of sight of the main road.

"*Thank*you," Homura says, voice quiet and uncertain.

"*Hey, what're friends for?*" you ask. "*You're welcome, Homura.*" You smile at Mami, and gesture grandly with both hands. Grief gathers and spreads as if pressed flat by some vast hand moulding playdough, deep purple material flattening into a carpet patterned in twisting fractal patterns of eye-wrenching depth.

"*Thank you, Sabrina,*" Homura says again. After a short pause, she adds, "*See you later.*"

"*See you, Homura.*" You plop down on your carpet, Mami sitting right beside you to nestle comfortably into your side.

Best to let Kirika you're on your way. "*Hey, Kirika, we're.on our way,*" you say as you will the carpet upwards and onwards.

"*Oh. Please hurry,*" she respond.

"*Yeah, we're flying in,*" you say, exhaling a slow sigh snatched away by the wind of your passage.

A thought occurs to you. "Say, Mami," you say, raising your voice to be heard over the rushing wind. "Do you think it's possible to reverse-engineer an enchantment?"

Mami blinks. "Of course it is," she says.

"Oh," you say. "Well, OK, then. Hmm... What about *adapting* enchantments? Start from one, and then change it to a similar effec-"

Mami's already nodding. "It is," she says. "That's how I learned many of my own enchantments. I went from... simple durability, to the shield, to... specific shield configurations, for example."

"Oh, that's cool," you say, smiling. "You're amazing, you know that?"

"Ah..." Mami hides her expression of pleased embarrassment by nuzzling her head against your shoulder.

You chuckle. "You're good, Mami. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise, not even yourself," you say. Truth be told, you were a little worried about asking Mami about the enchantments. That seems to have been a rather thankfully misplaced fear, though.

Kirika's waiting for you when you arrive, glass door thrown open well before you land in their backyard.

You hop off the carpet to the grass, waving to Kirika. "Hey, Kirika," you say. You can sense her Soul Gem... upstairs, next to the clear Seed, and next to Oriko's Soul Gem. Which seems more or less unchanged from the last time you'd seen it - Pythia's still there, if oddly distorted, almost as if you're 'looking' through a heat haze, or trying to 'hear' underwater.

And there's something in her hand, dangling loosely at her side. It *looks* like a rock to your eyes, but... it's a complete *void* in your Grief senses.

Huh.

"Hey, Sabrina," Kirika says, biting at her lip. "You're here to help Oriko?"

"Yeah," you say, absently dissolving the carpet as Mami dismounts from it. "And so's Mami. I promised I'd be here, right? And ah... what's that in your hand?"

Kirika nods, her eyes dropping to the rock in her hand. "Oh... I tried what you asked me to. I... succeeded in making an antimagic enchantment, I guess. I didn't get anywhere with making my antimagic field a constant effect, though."

Huh.

She turns and heads into the house, bounding up the stairs. You follow.

When you get to the room, you find Oriko lying right where you'd left her, her skin grey and, well, corpse like. Mami winces, her expression falling a little as she glances away from Oriko to you. There's a laptop lying on the bedside table, the browser open to an awfully familiar website.

Kirika waits next to the bed, giving you an expectant look.

- [x] When we're there, degrief Kirika. Bring Mami up to speed.
- [x] Remake the pain blocking ring. Usual warnings.
- [x] Run healing magic on Oriko's body. Remove any damage brought by necrosis. Wake Oriko up.
- [x] Everyone is probably hungry at this point. Suggest ordering take out?
- [x] Discuss plans on how to proceed.
- [x] Ask Kirika if she made any progress. If not that's okay.
- [x] Enchantment is probably the surefire way to go.
  - [x] If Mami's remarks on reverse engineering were promising, suggest making an enchanted pain blocking ring with grief assistance and letting her look at it.
  - [x] If that idea doesn't pan out, while Mami attempts enchantment, try using a shell of magic to make a second grief ring sustain itself.

I, ah, substituted 4chan styling and... flavour for 2chan, because I don't know 2chan at all. Call it... localization. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# To the White Forest pt. 24

"We should," you agree with a warm smile at Mami. You link arms with her and head to the kitchen, waving at Homura as you pass the living room. She doesn't seem to notice you, though, or maybe she's just ignoring you in favour of staring at you inside the shield.

"Well, this is my life now," you inform her gravely from inside said shield. "Hamster-balled forever."

You eye the rock above your head, floating suspended in the middle of the shield, and start walking. You trundle across the floor until you bump into Homura's feet, giving her an accusing stare.

"I was thinking we could make some dan-dan noodles," Mami tells you, motioning towards the packet of defrosting minced pork. "I know Homura loves cream stew, but she can't have it for every meal."

"Well, we *are* trying to fatten her up," you muse. "And it's not like we'd actually get *fat*-fat as magical girls."

Mami gives this a moment's consideration. "It's still not healthy," she decides.

"Probably," you agree, and laugh. "Sichuan style, right? Do we have crushed peanuts? Ah, wait, no, we have whole ones. I'll grind them up."

"Chinese style," Mami agrees with a smile. "We don't have the time to do the Japanese style ramen. I'll start on the sauce."

And at the same time, you're whizzing about the living room at a dead sprint, ricocheting off the walls like a crazed pinball. "So what testing did you have in mind, Homura? Also, we've decided you can't have cream stew for every meal, so we're making something else for dinner."

"Durability with use," Homura says drily, watching you carom off the coffee table leg. "Is the enchantment weakening?"

You pause, skidding to a halt and extending your magical senses to check. "No, it doesn't seem to be," you say, and flick your hand out. A miniature hammer flashes into existence, and you swing it overhead to slam into the shield from the inside.

There's a bright flash of light, and you're knocked on your ass. "Ow."

"Sabrina?" Mami asks, giving you a concerned look over the heating pan.

"Nah, it's fine, just messing with Homura's shield," you say, shaking your head. You give her a reassuring smile, and return to grinding up the peanuts in the mortar and pestle while giving Homura an accusing look.

Homura shrugs.

"In *better* news, that doesn't really seem to have weakened the shield enchantment at all," you announce, deciding to be the better person. "Also, have you considered protecting Soul Gems with this? And, y'know, giving them to our non-magical girl friends."

"Yes," Homura murmurs. "Your... chibi is controlled from your Soul Gem, correct?"

"Yeah," you say, and blink. "Yeah, that's a good point. It clearly doesn't block magic. Can you make it less obvious, though? It's protection, yeah, but it would be best not to paint a glowing target on our Soul Gems even if they're protected." You knock your fist against the side of the shield wall meaningfully, watching the ripples of light race out from the touch.

"I don't know," Homura admits. "I will need to experiment."

"We have time." You grin up at her, warm and encouraging.

You stifle a giggle as you start whisking the peanuts into a sauce. Mami gives you an inquisitive look. "I just told Homura she has *time*," you say, grinning.

"Oh, Sabrina," Mami says, shaking her head and bumping her hip against yours as she heads over to the fridge.

You inspect the anchor stone for the shield, tugging lightly on it. There's a certain amount of give to it, yielding under your hands, which means that it's somewhat elastic. Which means you can *bounce*.

By the time dinner's ready, you've managed to bounce the shield off the floor and onto Homura's lap. She seems faintly exasperated, but hasn't removed you. Homura flicks the shield with a finger when she sees Mami emerging from the kitchen with bowls of steaming noodles, picking you up by the back of your shirt and wordlessly depositing you on Mami's shoulder.

You promptly burrow yourself under Mami's hair and hug her neck, making a pleased little noise.

"How did the testing go, Homura?" Mami asks, setting the bowls out. You follow up with utensils, little saucers of seaweed salad, and bowls of soup balanced on discs of Grief.

"It went well," Homura murmurs. "It would be good to test it fully."

"Next training session," Mami says with a broad smile. "We definitely want Sayaka to help, too, since she has such a vast array of powers at her disposal. Come, eat up!"

Dinner is delicious, as is right and proper. It's Mami's cooking - of *course* it's delicious. Sure, you helped, but it's Mami's cooking. Savoury pork, a bit spicy and just a touch sweet with the rich creaminess from added chunks of peanuts. Judging from the way Homura vacuums down the noodles, you think she agrees about the deliciousness.

Mami offers you a single noodle, but you turn it down. You'd rather not find out what happens when you remove the enchantment after *eating* something.

"Oh, hey - Homura, do you have anywhere to be after dinner?" you ask. "Or rather, I was thinking we could put in the order for the trackers after dinner- ah, damn." You make a face as a thought strikes you. "I... don't have a credit card."

"I do," Homura murmurs. "I can pay for it."

"Ah, uh, if you're OK with that," you say.

Homura nods.

"I have one too," Mami volunteers, nudging you gently.

"I'll pay for it," Homura repeats patiently.

"Ah- I didn't mean to undercut you, Homura," Mami says, shaking her head. "I, um..."

You snicker, patting Mami's shoulder. "I get it. Homura, do you want me to pay a part of it? I mean, I've still got some yakuza cash and stuff."

"That won't be necessary," Homura says, and for a wonder, *doesn't* flip her hair. Which is just as well, because non-magically magical hair or not, flipping her hair at the dinner table would probably end up with said hair in the sauce, and that's just no good.

Mami stifles a giggle.

By unspoken consensus, you all keep the rest of dinner light, savouring the noodles. Homura helps with the dishes, and finally, the three of you crowd around Mami's computer to make the order. *And* you clamber onto Mami's head, flopping comfortably amidst a thatch of soft, blonde hair.

"Overnight delivery," Homura declares, pointing over Mami's shoulder.

"Are you sure?" Mami asks, eyeing the delivery costs doubtfully.

"Yes," Homura responds. She pays for it without complaint, but then again, she has more than enough paranoia to drive *this* particular purchase and the money to back it up. You vaguely wonder if she's ever had to actually contend with paying credit card fees, what with the time loops.

Hm.

... well, that's something to deal with in the future.

"Alright," Mami says, smiling and clicking a few times. "That's the order placed, then. It should be here... in two days from now."

"Huh, quick," you say.

Mami shrugs and smiles as she stands to fuss with the scanner beside her computer. "Overnight delivery."

She pulls a piece of paper from her bag -the defense pact with Yuki- and tucks it into the scanner. "I said I'd send her a copy," she offers by way of explanation.

"Ah, right," you say, smiling. "Good thinking, I'd completely forgotten."

Mami ducks her head, pleased, and sends off the email.

"Homura, you're welcome to stay as long as you like," you say, beaming at her. "But I'm guessing you have plans, right?"

Plans involving stalking Madoka, of course.

"Yes," Homura says, hesitating for a long moment before adding, "Thank you. You and Mami."

"You're very welcome," Mami says. She beams at Homura. "You're always welcome here, Homura."

"Definitely," you agree.

Maybe you're imagining it, but Homura looks rather touched as she nods, and looks away. Nevertheless, you all exchange farewells, seeing Homura off. As the door shuts, you turn to Mami, and hug her.

"Well, just us left," you say, smiling softly.

"You're here," Mami says simply.

"So what's to do tonight?" you ask. "You have homework, right?"

Mami nods in agreement, her hair bobbing. "I do," she says, but rather than step away from you, simply burrows into your hug instead.

You savour the warmth, but disengage a few minutes later so you can actually settle into making sure Mami doesn't fail her classes. You wind up sitting side by side at the coffee table, leaning against each other and perched comfortably on her lap as Mami does her English homework. An essay.

Of course, you've got your own homework, of sorts.

It seems like your control enchantment let you shape your chibi body without going fully into a trance, which could be *extremely* valuable if it means you can pre-form enchantments. Vancian casting, as it were, with prepared materials. Though speaking of your chibi-body...

You scramble onto the table, plopping down right where Mami can see you, and give her a sunny smile. It'd be interesting to confirm that you can enchant with your miniature self, though you don't anticipate any problems there, considering you can summon your hammer without any problems. Nevertheless, testing and repeatability are at the core of good science, and so you summon a small blob of Grief to your hands, and a larger one to your other set of hands.

"*Hey, Kirika?*" you murmur as you start channeling magic. "*Got a moment?*"

"*Eh? 'brina?*" Kirika says. "*Did you want Oriko?*"

"*No, no - just real quick, let her know I'll swing by to share some important news with you either tonight or tomorrow,*" you say. "*Also, I'd like to talk to you privately at that point.*"

"*Uhhhh sure,*" she responds, sounding confused. "*Yeah, gotcha. Was that all?*"

"*Yeah,*" you say. "*Catch up later!*"

Grief moulds gently under your hands, all four of them. You can feel the faint shimmer of enchantment winding through the Grief. You stare thoughtfully at the Grief, rolling it between your palms as you think.

The thing is, this *is* an enchantment. Which is not the same thing as your Witch constructs. You don't *will* this into being what you want it to do, you simply sink magic into it and shape it physically like clay. You still had to will the chibi into animate life, but it took *no* time at all.

You frown thoughtfully, and toss the small blob of Grief at yourself before smushing everything all together and pinching off a small chunk to lob back at yourself. So if you start with the *same* batch of enchanted Grief, can you shape different Witch constructs from it?

Mami giggles, and you look up to find her looking at you.

"It's cute," she says, motioning at both of your yous.

You shrug, and grin at her. She smiles back, and returns to her essay, pen skating busily across the page.

One of your anti-pain rings, and a privacy construct. You start shaping the Grief, simple touches snapping the Grief into shape, and before long, you have both a pedestal with a mounted circlet, and a ring. Neither of which actually *work*, but that only takes a moment of *will*, and-

The privacy sphere blooms into existence, the world around you hazing as the field spreads.

"Is something wrong, Sabrina?" Mami asks, blinking at you.

"No, not at all," you say. "I was just testing my enchantment. It seems like I can enchant Grief to... more easily accept being turned into a construct?"

Mami purses her lips in consideration. "Your enchantment *does* seem more closely bound with your power than is usual," she agrees. "But that does seem reasonable."

"And it doesn't seem like I have to decide what I want to do with the Grief before enchanting it, either," you say, fiddling with the ring. It's practically dinner-plate sized, for you. "I just need to shape it physically, which is very interesting."

"Does the shape matter?" Mami asks.

"Good question!" you say. "I'll find out."

And you proceed to do just that, dissolving the privacy pedestal down to Grief. The enchantment dissipates harmlessly, falling apart with the physical form, and you swap in a fresh blob of Grief just to be sure of starting with a clean slate. This time, you first smush it into a rough lump, and take a moment to infuse your will into it.

It doesn't take. You frown, trying to *push* your will at it, but you can feel the edge of the precipice right there, that would have you impress your *will* upon the world. That's not what you're after, not the trance method of making a Witch construct.

You turn your attention to shaping the Grief a little more, moulding it into a nice, smooth sphere. And once more, you try to will it into doing what you would.

The privacy field blossoms once more, the steady sensation of *Witch* a constant accompaniment as you set the sphere down.

"So shape doesn't matter," you conclude. "Not that it ever did for the constructs, of course. But I need to have put... *effort* into shaping it before it actually works."

"Maybe it's like dough," Mami says, setting her pen down for a moment. "You have to knead it a bit first so it can support the magic?"

"Something like that," you agree, frowning thoughtfully. "Well, it's a good technique to have, anyway. Do you mind if I keep the field up for a bit? I want to do something."

"Ah? Go ahead," Mami says. She gives you a curious look as you pull Kuroki's phone out of your bag, before making a quiet noise of understanding.

You look at the phone, scowling thoughtfully. You fixed Mami's table, using Grief. Kuroki's phone, on the other hand, was hurled with puella magi strength into a wall hard enough to dent steel. The case and screen are shattered, and the internal circuit boards aren't in good shape. You're not... really sure you can recover it, what with oxidation damage and microscopic chips that you must have left behind.

Still, you won't know if you don't try.

A thought envelops the phone in Grief, seeping into every crack and split. And...

The flash memory is cracked. The chip is simply shattered along with the board underneath it, the pins torn out by the force of the impact. And you're... just not sure how to fix this, not when there are bits simply *missing*.

Damn.

"Hmm?" Mami says.

"... I said that out loud, didn't I?" you ask. "No, it's just that I don't think I can repair Kuroki's phone."

"Ah," Mami says, grimacing.

"Yeah," you say with a sigh. "Damn."

With a thought, you dissolve the privacy sphere, letting the curtain fall, and you lean back, closing your eyes. You can feel Mami's worried gaze, so you peek open one eye and grin at her. "I'm fine, just annoyed," you say.

"If you're sure," Mami says with a smile.

"I am," you say.

Mami nods, and returns to her essay.

"Er... Mami? Do you mind if I call someone by telepathy?" you say. "And if you want to, you can listen in? A magical girl who Nadia mentioned before."

"Ah... go ahead, Sabrina," Mami says. "I'd love to listen in."

"Alright," you say, and lean back again. "*Nadia? Do you have a moment?*"

"*Sabrina, Miss Tomoe, hello,*" Nadia's accented tones respond after a few moments. "*Is there news?*"

"*Ah... not really,*" you say. "*We did go to Asunaro, though.*" You give Nadia a quick rundown without the specifics.

"*Yes, I see,*" Nadia says. "*What did you need?*"

"*Could you connect me to Tsubaki Mikoto?*" you ask. "*You know her, right?*"

"*Yes, it will be no problem,*" Nadia says. "*One moment,*fimti?"

You hum, and give Mami a warm smile as you wait.

OK, so... first, breaking as requested. Seocnd, just note that Science posts tend to take a lot of words. I'm happy enough to write 'em, just note that they tend to crowd out other things happening. Like here. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

Basically, what I'm saying is you have to *choose* between doing science and other things, in most cases. Also, granted, you can keep requesting more posts, but I would actually like to wrap up the day. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

# Interloper pt. 34

You can only look on helplessly as Homura virtually huddles in on herself.

"Homura? Please, talk to me?" you ask softly, reaching out to her hesitantly, before stopping your hand short of actually touching her.

She shakes her head slowly, eyes closed. "You..." she whispers a single word, before lapsing into silence again.

"Homura, please. What's... what's on your mind?" you ask, almost pleasing.

"My *magic*," she whispers, left arm shifting just far enough for the shield to clack against the side of the bench. Her head slumps back against the bench, lolling backwards.

A laugh, a strangled, choked thing. "*You*," she says, opening her eyes. Tired amethyst eyes fix themselves on you.

You?

You blink at her. You... think you've got an idea of what she means.

"You *know*," she says, eyes drifting to stare into the distance, through the open door of the lobby. "You *know* what's... what I've been through. How *long* I've... But *you*... I've never seen you before." Her hands close into white knuckled fists in her lap.

Yeah. She's said as much before, hasn't she?

"I'm here *now*, Homura," you say.

"*Yes*," she hisses before you can get any further, her voice quiet, but almost... *edged*, a tinge of desperation underlying every word. "I... we... *you* might actually win. We might beat Walpurgisnacht. We might..." she swallows, throat working convulsively. "We might keep Madoka *safe*. It's been so *long*..."

You nod in agreement. "Yeah, we wi-"

Homura shakes her head, a single sharp jerk to the side. "I... Oriko killed Madoka once. It... she isn't necessary. She *k-killed Madoka*. She could still be *dangerous*."

"Homura... you know that..." you bite your lip. "You know that I was *terrified* of Oriko when we first met, right?"

"Then *why*?" Homura asks, frustration leaking into her tone.

You exhale slowly, mind whirling. You have answers you could give. Could. Maybe *should*.

But...

You're not sure Homura needs an *answer*, right this moment.

She needs... reassurance.

*Won't*. Not yet.

"Homura?" you ask softly. "May I give you a hug?"

Her expression shifts, fear and worry giving way to faint annoyance, overshadowed by confusion. "I..." She breaks off, sighing. "Go ahead."

You reach out, wrapping your arms around her too-thin frame, and you hug her close. Despite everything, she slowly relaxes, body slumping against you. Too thin, too worn, *still* too tired despite everything.

Short update today. Homura's not much of a talker.

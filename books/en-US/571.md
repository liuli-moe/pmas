# "We Don't Go To Asunaro..." pt. 17

"Thanks, Sabrina!" Sayaka says, beaming at you. You offer your fist, and she bumps it, grinning.

"Um, who's taking the Grief Seed?" Kazumi asks, waving at it.

"I think you should have it," Mami says, smiling. "If we're all in agreement? Sabrina, Sayaka? Homura?"

"Yup!" Sayaka says, flashing a thumbs up. "Not like we need it!"

"I'm fine with that," Homura says.

"I'm not!" you say, stooping to pick up the Seed. You flash a bright grin at the Asunaro girls before they can say anything, and continue. "I'm gonna make it a Clear Seed first. You've got seven girls. I mean, one Clear Seed will keep you all going for a *long* time, but it'd be easier if you had two to share around, yeah?"

Kazumi blinks, and then beams. "Um- thank you, Sabrina!" she says. "But only if it isn't too much trouble."

"It's not," you say, holding the Seed up. "This won't take me long - oh, cleanses for everyone, first?"

"Yup," Sayaka says, reaching for the Soul Gem on her midriff.

A round of cleansing and a few minutes' focus later, you have a Clear Seed and another heaping mass of Grief. You present the Clear Seed to Kazumi, grinning broadly - though you can't quite suppress a bit of unease that you might actually have to write off that *first* Clear Seed as taken by Hijiri Kanna.

You can't say whether she's already an *antagonist* yet. She doesn't really *lose* it, according to your memories, until she finds out that she's a clone.

You shake those thoughts free as Kazumi takes the Grief Seed from you, and grin at her. "Here you go!"

"Thank you, Sabrina!" Kazumi says, eyes shining as she takes it.

"If nothing else, it would, ah, resolve the issue of Niko holding the other one hostage for her experiments," Umika says drily.

Mami beams proudly at you, and you reclaim her hand, interlacing your fingers together.

Sayaka snickers, twisting from side to side to stretch her spine. "Anyway, I should get going. Homework session! Homura, you coming?"

"Yes," Homura murmurs, turning to follow.

"... actually," you say. "Sayaka, do you think Hitomi would mind if we all tagged along?"

"Eh?" Sayaka says, blinking. "Uhh... I could ask, why?"

"I just thought it'd be nice if we could all hang out for that," you say, shrugging. A thought occurs to you, and you make a sheepish face before turning to Kazumi. "Though, um... well, I don't know if it'd do much for you. Sorry, I didn't think of that."

The black hair girl flashes you a grin. "That's fine!" she says brightly. "We could go explore Mitakihara... it's beautiful at night. Or we could go hunting! Three of us will be fine."

"Hitomi says it's OK!" Sayaka says, waving her phone. "Um, Kazumi, Umika, Kaoru, you're welcome too, if you want!"

"Oh," Kazumi says, brightening. "I'd love to! Kaoru? Umika?"

"I don't mind!" Kaoru says, flashing a thumbs up.

Umika smiles faintly. "Well, I haven't been to school in a while, but it would be nice to hang out."

You grin, bouncing on your toes. "Are we all good, then? Oh, wait - we should make sure the, um, victim will be alright."

You check again that the Witch Kiss has faded and return her to her cubicle, carefully arranging her as if she'd fallen asleep. By some unspoken agreement, you decide not to call Kyuubey. The little white rat will show up if it feels it needs to, after all.

It's a raucously cheerful group that heads off into the night, high on the success of an easy victory and the fact that you'd done *good*. Even Homura seems to be in a lighter mood than she usually is.

"*By the way, Sayaka,*" you speak over telepathy. "*Good work back there.*"

"*Yeah!*" Kazumi chimes in. "*We got there in the nick of time. Who knows what would have happened if we were slower?*"

"*Agreed,*" Mami says. "*Well done, Sayaka! Speaking of, I saw you learned some new tricks, Kazumi?*"

"*Mmmhm!*" Kazumi says. "*I haven't been slacking off!*"

You arrive at Hitomi's place in short order, all in good spirits. You *think* it's Hitomi's place, anyway, it's where Sayaka brought you.

... you feel kind of underdressed, in just a blouse and pants. This place is *fancy*. Hitomi, apparently, lives in an apartment building, but it's no *mere* apartment building, it's a *Luxury* Apartment Building. Carefully manicured greenery lines the sidewalks, tall hedges that muffle out the noise - and it's a little ways away from the city so it's quieter, but not so much so that it'd be inconvenient. A big glass door leads into a grand, marble-floored atrium lit by tasteful chandeliers.

... definitely underdressed.

"Yep," Sayaka says, popping the syllable. "I know, right?"

"Your friend is kind of scary," Kaoru breathes, eyes wide.

Sayaka snorts, starting up the path. "C'mon, let's go! I actually have homework to do, you know."

It turns out that Hitomi lives at the penthouse suite, because of *course* she does. The perfectly coiffed receptionist nods at Sayaka, apparently recognising her on sight, and makes a note on the computer before waving you towards the elevator, which is utterly silent and so smooth that you wouldn't have noticed the motion without the masses of Grief you have outside as reference points.

Homura takes it all in stride, standing in the middle of the elevator watching the numbers go by. Mami seems unruffled, though that might be more from the fact that she's cuddled happily against your side. Kazumi seems to have arrived at the same solution, huddled in the corner with her friends.

The door slides open with a cheerful ding, opening into a large, well-lit room. The walls are wood panelling and faux-paper patterning, with a little raised step in front of you with a few shoes lined up neatly against it. Seconds later, the wood-and-glass door swings open to reveal Hitomi, Madoka peeking around her shoulder.

"Hello, everyone!" Hitomi says, beaming. "Thank you for coming!"

"No, thank you for having us!" Kazumi says, beaming right back at her. "We're grateful for your hospitality even though we only met today."

"Indeed," Umika agrees, nodding.

"Yes, thank you for inviting us, especially on such short notice," Mami says with a warm smile. "Hello, Madoka."

"Ah, it's nothing. We're all just here to do homework and hang out, right?" Hitomi says with a shake of her head and a smile. "Come in, everyone!"

You all remove your shoes, leaving them behind as you exchange greetings and enter the apartment. Homura drifts over to hover near Madoka, who beams happily at her.

You can't help but stare through the floor-to-ceiling window dominating their living room, all of Mitakihara laid out at your feet. Of course, it's not that different a view from times you're flying or roofhopping, but it's an entirely different *experience*, framed in carefully modernized Japanese aesthetic.

"Ah, welcome to our home!" a new voice says.

You turn to spot an older version of Hitomi. Well, not quite. Hitomi's cheekbones probably came from her father. Hitomi's mother -and it must be- has hair a vibrant, *bright* green, pulled into a loose ponytail over one shoulder. Crow's feet around her eyes lend her an air of maturity and sharp, no-nonsense intelligence.

"Ah, mama!" Hitomi says, smiling and hurrying over. "These are my friends. You know Sayaka, this is Akemi Homura, one of our classmates. This is Tomoe Mami, my upperclassman, and Sabrina, her friend. And this is Kazusa Michiru, Misaki Umika, and Maki Kaoru, they're friends of Mami from out of town. Everyone, this is my mother, Shizuki Haruka."

"It's good to meet all of you," Hitomi's mother says. "Welcome! It's good to see that Hitomi's making new friends. Did you meet from school?"

Mami bows politely, and you follow belatedly. "Hitomi and I did, Mrs Shizuki," she says, taking your hand. "I'm afraid I'm imposing, Mrs Shizuki, for bringing my friends along."

"If anything, it's my fault," you say, smiling at Mami, then Mrs Shizuki. "It was my idea that we could all join this little study session. Thank you for extending the hospitality of your home to us, Mrs Shizuki!"

Her eyes flicker to your hands for the barest second before returning to your face. "It's no problem, Miss Sabrina, Miss Tomoe. You are all welcome here. Any friends of Hitomi are friends of ours."

Hm. You can't help but notice that look she gave you, nor the way she glances at the Asunaro girls.

... perhaps Hitomi came by that 'Girls can't love girls!' from *somewhere*.

Mrs Shizuki steps back, still smiling - and it's not like there's any trace of hostility on her face, either. "Don't let me keep you! Feel free to ask for any snacks or drinks if you like."

"Mama, isn't papa going to say hello?" Hitomi asks, blinking.

"Ah, later," Mrs Shizuki says. "He had to take an urgent call."

"Oh," Hitomi says, nodding. "I didn't realise. Thank you, mama! Um, this way, everyone." She turns and heads for the stairs in the corner of the living room.

Penthouse apartment, of course. Granted, Mami's apartment is a maisonette with two floors, but it takes an entirely different meaning when it's a full *three* stories, all lined with a dizzying glass window. You make your way across the soft rugs and up the stairs, still hand in hand with Mami.

"Ah... Miss Sabrina? Miss Tomoe? Could I have a word?" Mrs Shizuki calls.

... um.

"Of course, Mrs Shizuki," Mami says, pausing on the staircase and looking politely inquisitive.

You echo Mami's agreement, pausing and letting the others pass you on the stairs before descending back to the living room. You can't help but fidget a little, uncomfortable as Hitomi peeks over the railing before shrugging and heading into her room with everyone else. The door shutting feels oddly *final*.

"Please, sit down," Mrs Shizuki says, waving at the sofa. She waits until you do so before sitting herself, folding her legs primly.

"What did you want to speak about, Mrs Shizuki?" Mami asks. You can't help but admire her poise, though the way she squeezes your hand belies her perfect calm.

"I must first apologise in advance if this sounds strange," Mrs Shizuki says, smiling in a rather self-deprecating way. "I wasn't quite sure with Sayaka, but I think, on seeing all of you, that I'm right."

... *um*.

"Yes, Mrs Shizuki?" Mami asks, unruffled calm still firmly in place.

"You're all magical girls, aren't you?" Mrs Shizuki asks. "Oh, don't look so surprised. I was a teenager once too, you know."

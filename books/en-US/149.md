# Surface Tension pt. 26

"Eh," you shrug. "Maybe we can bring them here?"

Mami looks at you doubtfully. "I don't think the nurses would allow that."

"We can try," you say. "Besides, I don't think it'll be too hard. At worst, maybe we'll have to sign a permission slip or something?" You smile confidently, trying to convey a sense of 'this will all work out'.

"Eh, wait!" Sayaka says, looking alarmed. "You mean *now*?"

"Well, yeah," you say blithely. "The sooner the better, right?"

"Uh," Sayaka says. "You're bringing Hitomi here? To tell her?"

"That's the idea, yes," you nod. "And Kyousuke too."

"E-eh," the bluenette looks around. "Y-yeah, healing him would be great, too." Madoka looks at her worriedly, and then back at you.

"Sabrina, could we go outside a moment?" Mami asks, putting a hand on your shoulder.

"Sure," you say, rising to your feet and letting Mami lead you out of the lounge, just around the corner. There's a few nurses passing by in the corridor, but no one gives the pair of you a second glance.

"Sabrina," Mami begins, giving you a serious look. "I know what you're trying to do, and it's a *good* thing. But you don't need to fix everything in a day, you know?" She softens the minor rebuke with a smile.

"I..." you temporize.

"And besides..." she says, smile slipping slightly. "I... You just told her about Kyuubey, and..." the blonde chuckles, a forced sound. "*I'm* still... reeling, a little."

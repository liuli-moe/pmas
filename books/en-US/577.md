# Highway 17 pt. 2

*Empty quiver*.

You might as well borrow the term from the United States. It feels appropriate right now: you don't quite have a stolen nuclear weapon, but *someone* might as well have stolen the equivalent of a nuclear *reactor*. And perhaps you're over dramatizing it, but a Clear Seed in the wrong hands could do an *enormous* amount of damage. You'll happily compare it to a tactical nuclear weapon being stolen, indeed.

Kanna, Yuuri, or the Soujos, or someone new? Not the Yuuri from Ishinomaki, obviously. Of the options, the Soujos are probably the least worrying: they presumably have a clear and ready need for indefinite cleansing to maintain their collection.

A collection of Soul Gems, all *taken* from magical girls.

Hijiri Kanna, the mad, vengeful clone out for her wishborne creators' blood: Niko. Perhaps the most obvious motivation for an attack and a raid, but Niko hadn't been hurt at all. And then there's the *other* mad, vengeful clone, Asuka Yuuri, formerly Anri Airi. Of course, she isn't out for Niko's blood, she's out for the blood of *all* of the Saints, for the crime of not preventing her friend Yuuri from becoming a Witch.

Then again, you're not absolutely sure that that happened yet.

And then there's the biggest question: how did they know to take the Clear Seed?

It's not the most obvious target, which suggests enemy action of the unusually informed kind. You'd guess at Kyuubey. You've been *waiting* for the white *rat* to make its move.

Of course, if it were someone out to *hurt* the Saints -or Niko specifically-, you suppose they could pick worse targets to abscond with than the object of Niko's current obsession. *She's focusing on it so much, it has to be important!* isn't the most far-fetched thought to occur to someone, you don't think.

"*Alright,*" you say, blowing out a breath. "*Thank you.*"

"Sabrina?" Mami says, squeezing your hand.

"Well, it's not like I was going to let whoever it was get away with attacking my friends," you say, almost distantly. "I just have extra reason to... go after them. Alright."

You nod sharply, and focus on Kazumi. She looks back at you, determination set in her face and mirrored in Kaoru and Umika. "We'll go soon," you say. "Have you packed your things yet? I'll need a couple minutes to talk to my friends."

Kazumi nods sharply and turns, looping her arms around her friends' waists to tug them away. "We'll be waiting," she says.

You sag against Mami, leaning against her for support. "*Damn* it," you hiss under your breath.

"We'll handle it," Mami promises, wrapping her arm around you gently. "Nobody got hurt, so we just need to find the thief, right?"

"Yeah," you say. You can't help but recall an endless search amidst the dull monochrome and dead silence of Homura's timestop. With that cheery thought in mind...

"*Homura, Sayaka,*" you murmur through the aether, including Mami as a matter of course.

"*What's happening?*" Homura asks, nearly instantly.

"*We... I gave a problem,*" you admit. Dammit. For once, you have to live up -or down?- to Homura's instinctive response there. "*Niko's lab was broken into, and whoever it was stole the Clear Seed I gave to the Asunaro girls. Uh. Sayaka? Are you there?*"

No response - not from Sayaka, at any rate.

"*Who?*" Homura asks.

"*I don't know,*" you say, rubbing your face. "*But I- I can't let this go. I need to bring Kazumi and her friends back, and I need to hunt down the thief. I- can I trouble you to get Sayaka and come over? I don't want to leave her out of this conversation.*"

"*Yes,*" Homura says. "*One moment.*"

"Right," you murmur out loud. Mami cuddles anxiously against your side, and you draw strength from the contact, smiling a-

-t her.

Mami sucks in a breath, the sound instantly swallowed by the depths of Homura's timestop. You'd meant to head up to the roof, but in retrospect, your nice, comfortable apartment is a much better place to have a strategy meeting.

"Thanks, Homura," you say, nodding at your newly-appeared friend. She has Sayaka, as requested, but the bleunette looks mostly asleep still - transformed, but somehow still dishevelled and hanging off Homura's shoulder for support. Homura, on the other hand, stands ramrod stiff, obviously uncomfortable with the contact.

"Good morning, Homura," Mami greets, already starting to pull ribbon from her sleeve to loop around all of you. "Shall we move to the sofa?"

"Yeah, probably a good idea," you agree, accepting a loop of golden ribbon around your wrist. You walk forward to relieve Homura of her semi-comatose burden, draping Sayaka on the sofa and shaking her gently. "Sayaka? You with us?"

"Mmmmrmgrm," Sayaka mumbles, managing a glare at you. "*Why*."

"Because someone broke into the Asunaro girls' lab, and stole the Clear Seed I have them," you say tartly, planting your hands on your hips. "I'm going to go and do something about this... situation. Because you wanted to be part of the team, and that means when *we* get woken up in the middle of the night for some crisis, I spread it around with a shovel."

*That* gets Sayaka's attention, her eyes flaring wide. "What?"

"You heard me," you say. "*I* got woken up in the middle of the night for a crisis, so I'm spreading it around with a shovel."

"No, not that," Sayaka snaps. Yep, she's awake now. "The other thing."

"I visited Asunaro this morning," you say, starting to pace. "Well, yesterday morning, now. I left them a Clear Seed, because they were having, ah, hunting issues. Not enough Grief Seeds to go around. They also have a magical girl who's good at science-y stuff, and she was examining the Grief Seed - Kanna Niko. Unfortunately, someone broke into her lab a couple hours ago, knocked her out, and stole the Clear Seed."

"And we're going to go get it back?" Sayaka asks, eyes bright.

"I can't let this go, for more reason than one," you say crisply, pivoting on your heel and gesturing first at Mami, then yourself. "Niko's a friend of Kazumi, Kazumi's a friend of Mami's, and I daresay myself. That's reason enough right there. She's very good at the whole science thing too, and she might have some very useful insights." Your eyes flick over to Homura, to make sure she knows what you're hinting at.

"More than that?" you clench a fist. "Clear Seeds in the wrong hands would be *devastating*. I *cannot* let *anyone* think they can steal one and get away with it."

"So we're gonna go get it back," Sayaka says, grinning.

"The question is who's going," you say, letting the clenched fist fall.

"I'm going," Mami says, catching your eye and patting the spot on the sofa beside her.

"Me too!" Sayaka says instantly.

"We're not leaving Mitakihara undefended," you say. You force yourself to relax a little and sit down next to Mami. "Homura?"

"I'll stay," she says, eyes sharp.

"You're sure?" you ask, eyes roving all of your friends. You hold up your hands. "I'm not saying you shouldn't come, or should stay, any of you. I'm saying we shouldn't... I don't know, make snap decisions."

"I'm going," Sayaka says, jaw setting stubbornly. "I'm not going to be useless again."

"I'm going too," Mami says, wrapping her arms around your waist. "I- I'm not going to let you go into danger without me."

You can't help but soften into her embrace, squeezing your eyes shut, the bite of too little sleep gumming them shut for a moment too long. "And... Homura? I know someone needs to stay and guard the city, but..." You trail off, meeting her eyes. You've told her what Asunaro might hold, what Niko might figure out, with motivation.

"Who else would?" Homura asks, unflinching.

"Alright," you say. "Just... keep in mind, Sayaka, Mami, you'll be missing out school. I'm not saying 'no', just... you'll be missing it, yeah? And... one more thing. One of our potential enemies has mind control, or mind-affecting powers."

"All the more reason for us to go along," Mami says, nodding. "I... Sabrina, you're everything."

"Mind control, huh," Sayaka says. "Sounds like a job for clones."

"I... yeah, clones might work," you agree. Though you're not sure *more* clones is the solution to Asunaro. There are already two sets of doppelgangers in Asunaro, originally three and a half, had you not interfered. "I kind of want antimagic, though."

Homura's eyes snap to you, razor-sharp focus intent on you.

You blow out a breath. "I kind of want Oriko and Kirika along on this one," you say.

"*What?*" Sayaka bursts out. "Why them?"

"Kirika has antimagic," you say. "Extra eyes can only help, if we're hunting for a thief. And honestly, I don't feel comfortable leaving Oriko in the house for that long." You turn your attention to Homura, half cajoling, half hopeful. She hasn't said *no*. "They'll be out of the city."

"You trust them not to run?" Sayaka says, frowning.

"They could run *now*, if they wanted to," you say. "What prevents them from doing so is knowing that if they do, we *will* be coming after them. And I don't see how that would change, whether they're here or there."

"How would we explain them to Kazumi and her friends?" Mami asks.

"That is an excellent question!" you say. "I'm not sure. I... Homura? What do you think?"

"Mikuni wasn't enthusiastic about Asunaro when we talked," Homura says flatly. "If they'll be out of the city... then take them." Amethyst eyes hold yours, almost hypnotic. "But be on guard."

# Hazard Course Pt. 11

You're *not* going to indulge yourself. Nuh-uh, nope. You're going to trust Sayaka and leave her to it - she doesn't *need* you hovering over her shoulder all the time, and besides, she has a handle on Kyouko that you don't. Even if she's pushing Kyouko, it's with a purpose and properly considered.

OK, *one* glance back as you halt on the edge of the roof, because you have about as much self-control as Yuma, who has absolutely zero shame and is staring avidly over her shoulder. You trust Sayaka, sure, but you're *curious*, dammit!

Kyouko's face is *flaming* red, almost as red as her hair and glowing like a damn beacon even through the curtain of the rain and dammit, now you're even more curious. There's not that many things that can actually embarrass Kyouko, and embarrassed she *is*, with her arms folded in a huff and eyes averted from meeting Sayaka's gaze. Sayaka herself seems to be speaking still, having stepped a little closer to Kyouko with her head ducked down - the kind of posture accompanied by a soft, urging tone, you imagine, aaaaand *that* is enough indulging your curiosity.

Dammit.

You rather hope you can weasel some tidbits out of Sayaka later, or this is going to bother you *forever*.

You clear your throat and tug lightly on Yuma's hand.

"Let's give them their privacy," you say.

"You first!" Yuma says.

"Yeah, yeah," you say. Off the side of the roof, an easy vault to the next building over -another office building, by the looks of it- brings you into view of the Barrier. Not too far from Sayaka and Kyouko, as a sudden burst of paranoia brings a reminder of the Soujous floating to the forefront of your mind.

You're pretty sure that you yourself would... *probably* be the target, but you can't rule out the chance that she might attack others, or even hold them as hostage against you. Best to play it a bit safer and not split up entirely - but you're close enough that you can just amble over to the far edge of the roof and peer at the Barrier entrance.

Yuma joins you a second later, bounding over and landing in a crouch, then immediately pivoting and trying to catch a glimpse of Kyouko and Sayaka. To no avail, this time - not with the building in between.

"You know," you say after a moment. "I'm not sure I thought this through."

"Yup," Yuma agrees, having given up on trying to see what's happening and moving up to stand beside you, peering at the Barrier.

It's a Barrier: a hazy, glowing latticework of symmetrical geometry, glowing faintly against the sullen rain and drifting vaguely eastward at just barely above walking pace. And more importantly, you can't really *tell* much about it from the outside, though you *do* get the vague impression of *jaggedness*? You're sure Mami or Homura or, indeed, Kyouko, would be able to tell more, but to your inexperienced eye, it's just... a Barrier entrance, and little more.

No Witch-kissed victims here either, not with the way the Barrier's just floating lazily between buildings. Maybe it's hunting for targets? But then again, you weren't expecting any - you can sense them from a *good* ways away.

It's also unpleasantly warm on this particular roof, the humming air conditioning compressors radiating enough heat to banish the chill of the rain, proving an unpleasant contrast with the chill in the air.

"Sssssooo," you say after another long minute drags by. "Watched any good shows lately?"

"Mmm... Yuma doesn't kno- wait, no- *I* don't know if it's *good*?" Yuma says. "But big sis let me watch Saya no Uta with her! She said it was a classic, very worth watching."

"Huh," you say. "I don't think I've watched that one."

"Big sis would call you a philistine," Yuma says solemnly. "Um... well, maybe she might not admit she watched something so, um, sweet?"

"She'd probably stab me is what," you say.

Yuma tilts her head, giving you a look out of the corner of her eye, the slight smile sliding right off her face.

"Big sis doesn't hate you," she says in a bare whisper, just loud enough to be heard over the rain.

"I know," you say, sighing and scrubbing a hand through your hair. "I know she doesn't. Not *hate*, but she doesn't like me, either. And like... I sort of know where she's coming from, but I don't *understand*."

Yuma nods, falling silent again.

"Some of it *is* anger, maybe jealousy, that I 'took' her place," you mutter, mostly thinking aloud. "Which... well, it's *sort* of true, but not completely. She still *has* a place with Mami. It's just... not the same as what they used to have together. And I don't think it can ever go back, because so *much* has happened since then. And that's one of the biggest parts of what's bothering her."

You blow out an aggrieved breath, rubbing your eyes, then pushing your fist into your temple. Unspoken, of course, is Kyouko's enormous guilt complex. You *know* where that one started from, too, considering what happened to her father - but again, you're not sure it's possible for *you* to unravel that. You hope Sayaka's making progress.

"'course, this is all speculation on my part," you say. "I don't *know* her that well. I really, *really* hope Sayaka's getting through to her."

"Sayaka doesn't let big sis get away with anything," Yuma says, nodding in agreement. "And big sis always complains about how you just go with everything she says."

"Yes, well, I like to try and accommodate others," you grumble. "I *like* being nice to people. Makes me happy, makes others happy, except for *certain* people who are just congenitally contrarian and don't *let* themselves accept good things."

"I'm not sure what that means, but I'm sure you're right," Yuma says, reaching over to pat your hand condescendingly. "But big sis came here, didn't she?"

"Oh, she did," you say. "*That* much gives me hope, anyway."

You blow out an annoyed breath.

"Anyway. Enough about that, I trust Sayaka," you say. "How're *you* liking Mitakihara, Yuma?"

"It's *huge*!" Yuma says, shining up at you with a smile. "Big sis always told me stories about here, and I could always *see* it across the river. It's so nice!"

"It is, at that," you say, finding yourself smiling in kind at Yuma's sheer infectious joy. "How's the food and such?"

"You and Mami make *good* breakfasts," Yuma says. "Even big sis agrees. But she won't admit that, either."

"Hope we make enough, bottomless pits the both of you are," you say in amusement. "Where does it all *go*?"

"Right here!" Yuma says, patting her stomach.

"... yeah, I walked into that one," you concede. "Anyway. Do you think they're done?"

Yuma screws up her face.

"Won't big sis and Sayaka come over if they're done?" she asks.

"That's probably true," you say. "I- hold that thought."

You cock your head, because you *can* sense Kyouko and Sayaka moving now, both of them bounding over in your direction, and appearing a moment later. Kyouko flicks a glance over to you, her expression blank, then nods, and brushes past you.

"Big sis!" Yuma cheers, hurrying over and pouncing to wrap herself around Kyouko's leg.

"Hey, squirt," Kyouko says, ruffling her hair, then giving you a challenging look. "We continuin' the hunt, or no?"

You meet Sayaka's gaze, and she nods slightly.

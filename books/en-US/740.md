# Lowlife pt. 6

"Penny for your thoughts, Sabrina?" Mami asks, smiling faintly at you.

"Nothing I should share without privacy, unfortunately," you say.

You pause, blinking, and then you proceed to match Mami's rosy blush with one of your own.

"Phrasing?" you ask.

"... *just* phrasing?" Mami asks, managing a teasing smile despite the red staining her cheeks.

"... well..." you temporize, and laugh. Mami joins in, resting her head against your shoulder as you walk.

There's an odd kind of privacy to this, shielded by the curtains of rain cascading off the shared umbrella. And yet... your friends aren't too far away, either, bobbing splashes of colour threading through the crowds. Kyouko and Yuma on your left, Homura a step ahead.

"But yeah," you continue after a moment. "Just... thinking about matters."

"Mm," Mami says. She hums thoughtfully. "Can we talk to Homura?"

"Of course," you say, smiling at Mami, and quickening a few steps to catch up.

Mami sticks to you, of course, shoulder bumping against yours, and smiles at Homura as you approach. Your friend gives the two of you a quizzical look as you overlap your umbrella with hers, making some space for Mami to speak.

"Hi, Homura," Mami offers.

"Hello," Homura says, blinking slowly.

"I just wanted to say that I was very impressed with your gunplay," Mami says with a smile. "And... perhaps I'm off the mark, but thank you."

Homura tips a shoulder in a vague shrug.

"You're a good teacher," Homura murmurs quietly, albeit vaguely.

You have to admit, you're not entirely sure of Mami's deduction, either, or if even *Homura* knows for sure. Homura uses guns. Mami uses guns. And perhaps Homura only stopped using the pipebombs at Sayaka's request, and perhaps guns *are* terribly effective against all but the toughest Witches, and perhaps there *are* a million and one justifications.

Mami uses guns.

Homura uses guns.

Golden eyes flick up, and the tiny lines around them crinkle up into a warm, pleased smile when Mami finds you already looking at her.

You chuckle quietly, and walk onwards, Mami nudging you to take the lead - which makes sense, because you're almost there! Shopfronts dazzle with noise and lights and wares, blazing against the rain, heavenly smells cutting through the damp to attack your nose. The crowds around you are different now, more families, more teenagers braving the rain like you to hang out with their friends. More *colour*, more laughter, more noise.

Maybe it's just your imagination, but Kyouko seems to relax a little despite radiating annoyance, a rough sneer firmly in place as a shield against the looks that turn her way, judging her ratty jacket and shorts and demeanour. Yuma brightens yet more, the little ball of sunshine that she is, eagerly drinking in the sights and sounds.

Homura trails a step behind, a quiet but... *not* dissatisfied presence.

Her shield still bothers you. It's nothing you can place, your thoughts going in... hah, going around in *loops*. You have absolutely no reason to believe that Homura was lying when you'd asked her about the last loop - which matches what you think of as the last one. Not *truly* the last one, especially not given the Rebellion\*-that-must-never-be\*, but it's *the* endpoint.

And yet, here you are. Either time wound back without Homura's shield -perhaps from Madoka's Wish- or... an entire loop has gone missing.

Either way, something is *deeply* wrong there.

"Here we are," Mami says, squeezing your arm gently.

You blink out of your reverie, train of thought interrupted, and smile at Mami.

"*Trendy,*" Kyouko mutters disparagingly.

"That it is," Mami says with a light chuckle. "But the food is good."

"It looks nice!" Yuma says. "And there's lots of it, like Mami said!"

"Yeah, sure," Kyouko grumbles. "Not like *I'm* paying, anyway."

"How about you, Homura?" Mami asks. "Do you think you'd like to eat here?"

Homura eyes the menu for a moment, visible through the glass frontage of the cafe: a wood-framed blackboard, words rendered in flawless calligraphy and in turn surrounded by painstakingly drawn flowers and what appears to be their mascot, a particularly peppy looking purple flower.

"I'm fine with it," she decides at last.

"If you like it, I'm happy to eat here, Mami," you answer before Mami asks.

She laughs, squeezing your arm lightly. "Alright, it's settled then," she says. "It doesn't look too crowded, so let's grab a seat."

And so you head in, taking in the rest of the cafe. It's narrow, crammed between two other shopfronts, the counter squeezed right into the corner beside the staircase to the second floor. Kyouko was right to call it trendy, you suppose, though you'd personally call it cutesy. Bright, cheerful blooms of flowers -real flowers, not plastic!- planted in tubs running between tables underline the fragrance of food with subtle, floral undertones.

There's room enough to grab a seat on the first floor, but as it turns out, the second floor is quieter and just as cosy, so you find your seats above. Happy chatter mixes with the vaguely French-ish music, a pleasant counterpoint to the endless durmming of the rain.

"Steak," Kyouko announces as she slides onto a chair, cocking a challenging eyebrow at you.

"Which cut?" you ask. Mami takes your hand under the table, intertwining your fingers and squeezing gently. "Think they have T-bone and ribeye, from what I saw."

"T-bone," she says.

"Big sis..." Yuma says, tugging at Kyouko's hand. "Don't make trouble."

"No, no, I *did* offer to pay, and I can afford it," you say, smiling at her, then grinning at Kyouko as you rotate a small stack of cash into your ever-present bag. "Rare or medium?"

"Medium," Kyouko grumbles, looking away. Your grin widens a little more, because you can take that as a win.

"How 'bout you, Yuma?" you ask.

"Yuma saw that they had roast chicken? With roast potatoes?" Yuma says. "Or, um, fish and chips, um..."

"Take your time to decide," you advise. "Menu, menu... here you go." You grab a menu from the holder and slide it across to Yuma. "Homura? Mami?"

"I'll go order with you, Sabrina," Mami says. "I'd like to take another look at their specials, anyway."

"Of course," you say, squeezing her hand, which earns you a smile.

"... I'd like the steak, too," Homura says. She eyes Kyouko for a second, and then quirks an eyebrow at you.

"'course," you say. "Yuma? Wanna come with us to look at today's specials?"

"Nuh-uh!" Yuma says. "Yuma will have the half-a-chicken! And, um... a Coke?"

"Sure," you say. "Shall we, Mami?"

"Let's go!" Mami says.

She doesn't let go of your hand as you make your way down the stairs, either, running her fingers gently over the back of your hand in slow, rhythmic motions. You can't help but beam at her in response as she leans into your side, and after a few minutes queueing, you make your order. You insist on paying, of course, and you manage to get that far before your phone buzzes, so you shoot Mami a smile before answering.

You raise the phone to your ear, already hurrying out of the cafe to the street, where it's quieter. "Hi Mr. Momoe, this is Sabrina!"

"Big sis!" The excited squeal is definitely not Shin's baritone. "Hi!"

"Oh, hello, who's this?" you tease. "*You're* not Mr. Momoe."

"Big siiiis," Nagisa whines.

You laugh.

"Hello, Nagisa," you say. "How are you?"

"Excited! Uncle Shin says that he's going to drop me off with you soon, and can I come over early? Please say yes!" Nagisa begs.

"How soon would that be?" you ask. "We're having lunch now."

"Oh, that's OK!" Nagisa says. "I've already eaten!"

"Well, as long as it's OK with your uncle!" you say. "Ah, is he around?"

"Right here, Sabrina," Shin says. "Speakerphone."

"Ah, hello," you say. "I didn't know you were there."

"Perfectly fine," Shin says. "I hope it wouldn't be an imposition if I dropped Nagisa off early?"

"Uncle Shiiiiinnn big sis already said yes," Nagisa whines.

"Yeah, it's fine," you say, smiling. "We're eating at a cafe right now, if that's a problem? Madoka isn't here yet, though - she's meeting us after lunch, too."

"'Us' would be you and, ah... Miss Mami?" Shin asks. "If I recall her name correctly?"

"Yes and yes, plus three more of my friends that I don't think you've met," you say.

"I think that would be alright, then," Shin says. "Whereabouts are you?"

"We're near Shinmachi Mall," you say. "Uhhh..." You crane your head back to look at the sign. "Shion Cafe."

"Hah! I drive by there every day on my way to work," Shin says. "Is the food any good?"

"I'll find out and report later," you say, quirking a grin.

"Fair enough!" Shin says. "Will you be alright if I dropped Nagisa off in... half an hour?"

"Yeah, we'd be happy to have her," you say.

"Very well," Shin says, raising his voice to be heard over Nagisa's delighted 'YES!'. "In half an hour, then."

"See you soon!" you say. "Behave, Nagisa."

"Yes, big sis!" Nagisa says happily. "Bye!"

You smile to yourself and return to the cafe, finding Mami poring over the cakes in the display stand.

"I think I'll order us some desserts," she says, looking up and smiling as you approach.

"Well..." You loop your arm around her shoulders, and join her in taking a look. "Add a slice of cheesecake? Looks like Nagisa will be joining us."

"Didn't we give her cheesecake last time, too?" Mami muses.

"We did!" you say.

"I suppose I can't argue with that," Mami says, and sighs happily as she leans into the hug.

She insists on paying for the dessert, and though you put up a valiant fight, you inevitably fall to the onslaught of Mami pouting at you. Mami leads the way back up the stairs in triumph, humming cheerfully.

Lunch is *excellent*, and even Kyouko doesn't manage to find it in herself to complain about the food, practically inhaling her portion. You eat with hopefully a bit more decorum, but you have to admit that you'd worked up an *appetite* during the training.

"Are you sure you don't want to join us for the shopping later, Kyouko?" you ask as you sit back, setting your own utensils down. Mami flags a waitress down, asking for the dessert to be served.

"Fuck that," Kyouko grunts. "Yuma'n I are going hunting."

"If you're sure?" you ask. You don't really want to pressure her into it -and you doubt that'd *work*, anyway- but you *are* a little concerned. "I mean, I get it if you're all socialed-out for the day, but we'd be happy to have you along if you wanted, and I'm pretty sure Shinmachi has a big arcade."

"It does," Mami notes.

"Well, there you are," you say. And you have to admit, you're not entirely sure if Kyouko and Yuma *have* extra clothes or anything. "So... yeah."

"We're goin' *hunting*," Kyouko repeats.

"Alright," you say. "Well... we'll be just a call away if you need help."

Kyouko snorts, rolling her eyes at you.

"I've been doing just fine without needing your help," Kyouko says. "An' that was *before* I had Yuma to watch my back. Isn't that *right*, Yuma?"

"Yes, big sis," Yuma says obediently, and proceeds to give you a wink you'd call conspiratorial if it weren't for the fact that she just did it right in front of Kyouko.

"*Brat,*" Kyouko says, and ruffles her hair anyway.

"It's reassuring to know that you have someone to watch out for you," Mami says. "Thank you, Yuma."

"Right, I'm leaving," Kyouko snaps. She stands.

"You'll miss the cake," Mami says.

Kyouko sits.

"*You know, in retrospect, I'm not sure why I didn't just bribe Kyouko with food to come back to Mitakihara,*" you note to Mami.

Kyouko flips you off.

"Big sis, that's rude," Yuma says, butting her head against Kyouko's side. "Don't be rude."

"... can't fucking win," Kyouko grouses.

"You're up against *Yuma*," you say happily. "Of co- oh, hang on." You pull your buzzing phone out of your bag, checking the caller ID. "Gotta take this."

"Hi, Mr. Momoe!" you say. "Are you here already? I'll head out."

"We're approaching," Shin responds.

"Alright, on my way," you say, squeezing Mami's hand and standing.

You hurry outside, snagging one of your umbrellas from the stand and putting it up just as Shin pulls up by the pavement.

"Big sis!" The car door flies open, and a ballistic Nagisa crashes into your legs, shrouded in a bright yellow raincoat.

"Hey, Nagisa!" you say, grinning at her. "Hello, Mr. Momoe."

"Shin will do," the older man says, rolling down the window to peer at you. "Thank you for inviting Nagisa along today, she's missed you."

"Of course - I should have done it earlier, but I've had a busy few days," you say. "And I take it that you have too?"

"Business is booming," Shin says, echoing his earlier words. "Seems the Nakano corporation's taken more of an interest lately."

"... huh," you say. "Urban development?"

"Oh, it's not as if Mitakihara doesn't have that going on all the time, anyway," Shin says dismissively. "It just means more work for us. But I doubt you want to listen to an old man's complaints, so... have fun, Sabrina. Nagisa, be good, alright? I'll pick you up at four."

"OK!" Nagisa chirps. "See you, Uncle Shin!"

"Take care, don't let marketing bite," you offer with a grin.

Shin snorts as he rolls up the window. "I'm more worried about Mrs Kaname biting my head off," he grumbles. "Ask her daughter to pass on my regards, if you would? It might put her in a better mood..."

"Can do," you say, standing back and waving as he pulls off. You smile at Nagisa. "Shall we go inside?"

"It's cold out here!" Nagisa complains.

"I'll take that as a yes, then," you say.

When you get back inside, leaving both Nagisa's raincoat and the umbrella by the door, you find that Mami's pulled up a new chair - and that the cake is waiting for you, Kyouko giving you a grumpy, impatient look that narrows to surprise when she sees Nagisa.

"Everyone, this is Momoe Nagisa," you say. "Nagisa, this is Homura, Kyouko, and Yuma, and you remember Mami, right?"

"Hi!" Nagisa says, waving shyly.

"Hello," Homura says.

"Hallo!" Yuma says brightly. "I'm Yuma! This is Yuma's big sis, Kyouko!"

"This is *my* big sis," Nagisa says, grabbing your arm.

Yuma nods solemnly.

"Seriously? Are you picking up strays now?" Kyouko asks you, arching an eyebrow.

"Nagisa is not a stray!" Nagisa says.

"Glass houses, Kyouko. Glass houses," you say.

"... Yuma is not a stray, either," Yuma says, pouting and burrowing her head under Kyouko's arm. "Yuma has a big sis who she loves very much."

Kyouko grumbles inaudibly, mussing Yuma's hair.

"*Cake*!" Nagisa squeals, apparently only *now* noticing said confectionary.

Still, you smile indulgently and nudge her towards the empty seat, and the *not*-empty plate.

"Cheesecake!" you agree. "You liked it last time, right?"

Mami smiles as you take your seat beside her. "It's nice to meet you again, Nagisa."

Nagisa doesn't seem to hear either of you, though, her attention apparently wholly occupied by the generous slice of cheesecake, towards which she drifts in a haze of delight. And that's when it all goes wrong, you think, because Yuma notices too, and apparently decides to make it a competition of who can eat their portions faster.

The crumbs go *everywhere*.

"Your cakes are better," Homura murmurs to Mami, leaning away from the feeding frenzy.

Mami beams.

"Thank you, Homura," she says. "But I-"

"Mami, your cooking is amazing," you say firmly, shuffling your chair a little closer to Mami - and a little further from the shoals of piranhas disguised as little girls. "Baking included."

"... oh, alright, if I must," Mami says, beaming at both you and Homura.

"Yes, you must," you say.

"Well, thank you both," she says warmly.

Kyouko pops the last of her cake into her mouth and belches loudly. "Arright, that's that," she grunts, standing. "Yuma?"

"Mmh!" Yuma says, bouncing to her feet. "Thank you for the meal, Sabrina, Mami!"

"Take care of each other," Mami says.

"Aww," Nagisa says, pouting. "But I just got here!"

"We'll meet again!" Yuma says happily. "But I gotta go with my big sis."

Kyouko rolls her eyes and stalks off. Yuma offers a cheerful wave before hurrying off after her, chased by Nagisa's woeful pout. You track them in your Grief senses as Kyouko marches out of the cafe and off the streets, bounding to the rooftops and out of your range in short order.

"Did Nagisa upset Miss Kyouko?" Nagisa asks.

"Nah, it's definitely not your fault, Nagisa," you say. "She's just cranky from other things."

Kyouko *doesn't* dislike you, you think, but she... is definitely pricklier against you than with others. And it's not that you don't believe Mami, that Kyouko will learn to handle all the things that changed in her absence - and you're not sure that *you're* the person to try and fix this, even if Mami were wrong.

"She is," Mami admits with a sigh. "I never really saw her like this before."

Homura eyes you.

"It'll work out," you say, exhaling. You imagine letting your worries out with that breath, and try to project confidence for Mami and for Homura. "We got her back, didn't we?"

"Perhaps Sayaka should be convinced to talk to her more," Homura says.

"Not a bad idea," you admit. Then you grin at Homura, because *Homura* of all people offering suggestions on a social situation? Homura, of all people, suggesting that *Sayaka* might actually be able to help? "Yeah. Not a bad idea at all."

Homura shrugs, managing to look both faintly sheepish and embarrassed without actually changing her expression.

"Are we going to see Miss Madoka and Miss Sayaka later?" Nagisa asks.

"Yep!" you say. "We're gonna meet them soon."

"We might want to head to the shopping center first, actually," Mami offers with a smile. "We've already finished eating, after all, and there's no harm in arriving early, right?"

"Sounds good to me," you say. "How about it, Homura? Nagisa?"

"The biiiiiig mall?" Nagisa asks, blinking her oddly coloured eyes at you.

"That's the one," you say, laughing. "We're meeting everyone there."

"Yay!" Nagisa says, jumping to her feet, and hurrying off to the stairs.

"I'll take that as a yes, then," you say. "Homura?"

Your friend nods, giving Nagisa a long look, then you, and Mami.

"What?" you ask.

Homura shakes her head. "... it's nothing. Shall we?"

"If you're sure," you say, smiling.

She nods firmly and stands, pushing her chair back in. Mami takes your hand as you get up too, and you head out, making sure that Nagisa puts her raincoat on properly before you step forth once more into the rain.

Alright, so I felt I had to break the update here in a rather odd and unintended spot - I wanted to update before I slept, since tomorrow's gonna be busy.

Unfortunately, shelled watermelons and nyancats will have to wait for the next update. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

# Nova Prospekt pt. 37

"Thank you," Homura whispers into the silence. It's almost a sob. "*Thank you*."

"Thank you for trusting me with this, Homura," Mami says in response. You can feel her drawing a little closer to Mami, and you tighten your hug too so that Homura is firmly trapped between the both of you.

"I never wanted to be your enemy," Homura says. "You were my teacher."

Mami's quiet for a moment.

"I suppose we would have been, in another life," Mami agrees. "I would have opposed you for trying to prevent Madoka from making a Wish. That's not the case now. Though..." Mami chuckles. "I don't think I can be your teacher any more - I'm not sure I *have* anything left to teach you."

You beam at Mami.

"Sorry," Homura says, ducking her head.

"Don't be ridiculous," Mami says, patting Homura's back. "That's nothing to be sorry for."

"We're here for you, Homura," you say firmly. And if you put just a bit more emphasis on the *we*... Well, who's going to call you out on it? "And... you know that you can come to us for anything, right? To talk about anything you want?"

"Definitely," Mami agrees with an equally firm nod. "We'll always be willing to listen. And... I understand why Sabrina insisted that this wasn't her story to tell, why she had to keep it a secret. I won't tell anyone about this, either. I won't betray your trust, Homura."

And you didn't even have to prompt Mami for that. Madokami above, you don't know what you did to deserve Mami, but she's getting something nice for this. For everything she's done today. Because *that* was just about *the* perfect thing to tell Homura, to reassure her with.

Homura shivers, closing her eyes and nodding. "Alright."

There's nothing much left to be said, after that, so you let the conversation lapse. Mami seems to be content with the silence for now, meeting your eyes over Homura's head. You give her a smile, trying to convey as much warmth, as much *joy*, as you can. It probably looks irrevocably, *terminally* sappy from the outside.

Eh, who cares about that.

Homura reached out to Mami. And Mami reached back with acceptance, and empathy, and *understanding*. That's worth a lot. It's worth *everything*.

You feel Homura take a deep breath and shift under your arms, starting to sit up. You pull back and give her room to straighten, her blank, diamond-hard facade reasserting itself as she gathers herself once more. Well. Blank but for the subdued look of gratitude.

Mami brightens into a pleased smile, similarly easing back.

"Are you feeling alright?" she asks.

"I am," Homura says. "Thank you."

"I'm glad," you say, your own smile widening equally as much as Mami's. "And, ah... Homura? Thank you for trusting us."

Homura shrugs slightly, looking uncertain. "Is there anything else?"

"Ah... Sabrina?" Mami gives you a curious look.

"Not really," you say. "I- oh, actually, *not* related to all this stuff, but I've got some stuff I need to do this weekend, and I don't think I've mentioned it?"

"Oh?" Mami asks.

"Yeah, I figured I should let both of you know before I forget *again*," you say. "One, I really should get down to Fukushima to check on Airi and... you know." You gesture vaguely in the air, trying not to think about Rionna too much. "Sort things out. Probably tomorrow morning? Which, uh, right, that's not *weekend*, but upcoming stuff."

Mami giggles, and shuffles around Homura so she can tuck her chin on your shoulder, still giggling fondly.

"That makes sense," Homura says. A frown touches her brow. "What about Tokyo?"

"Tokyo..." You frown thoughtfully. "*Soon*, but I'm not sure when. I mean, it's the next big thing that's coming up for me, I guess? But anyway - weekend. Saturday I'm thinking about going to the mall to get a bank account set up and shopping."

"You can always use mine," Mami offers.

"And I appreciate that," you say, and slip an arm around her waist. She leans into the hug, smiling. "But, er... among other things, my account is probably going to have a lot of... weird deposits and withdrawals?" You hold your other hand up and flip it to display a bar of gold pulled from hammerspace.

"Ah," Mami says. "I suppose that safety net might be a good thing, yes." She cups her chin with one hand thoughtfully, but nods after a moment. "What about Sunday?"

"Cleansing trip," you say, raising a finger. "I'll need to check ahead on that, but that's... well, I've already made agreements for some, and I want to *help*, you know? Also, Saturday dinner with the Shizuki family, to bring them into the secret of magical girls and all that. And-" You nod at Homura. "It might be time, I think, to start recruiting for Walpurgisnacht. Maybe some visits to Kyoto or Kyuushu?"

A niggling thought bumps at the back of your brain. You've had thoughts about taking Mami out somewhere for dinner, and this weekend might be a good time. With your newly discovered range and flight capabilities, it's not out of the question to go somewhere *nice*, too - Tokyo, Paris, Rome, the *Moon*...

... you also have somewhat more vague notions of building a treehouse in Madoka's back yard so that Homura would have somewhere to perch while ~~stalking Madoka~~ standing watch at the Kaname residence, but you're not sure that's actually a *good* idea. The elder Kanames might disapprove.

You set that thought aside, just in time to catch Mami's firm nod.

"That's a good idea, Sabrina," Mami agrees. "This weekend would be a good time - your reputation will have had time to, ah, percolate, and it's not so close to Walpurgisnacht that prospective recruits would balk at the urgency."

"Agreed," Homura says.

"So, I'd definitely love to have you along, Mami, Homura," you ask, grinning at them. "I could definitely use your help, Mami, and you'd have a better grasp of the, uh, practical tactical situation on the day itself, Homura, buuuuuuut before I forget, all that is kind of still up in the air and subject to confirmation and what I *really* wanted to ask is if you're up for coming along on the *Saturday* shopping trip?"

"I'd be glad to, Sabrina," Mami says with a smile.

"Shopping?" Homura asks, giving you a quizzical look.

"Just to hang out!" you say. "You don't have to, but the offer's open, you know?"

"... maybe," Homura says, looking away. "Madoka still needs to be protected."

"That's fair," you say. Don't pressure her too much, don't steamroller her wants. "Though... well, we might make it a big group thing, everyone hanging out at the mall together."

Homura nods.

"I'll let you know, then," you say, clasping her shoulder and squeezing gently. "Anyway. That's the last thing I wanted to bring up, so... Mami? Homura?"

"Nothing that comes immediately to mind," Mami demurs.

"Nothing," Homura echoes, rising to her feet and brushing her skirt off. "I... I should go. I need to catch up with Madoka."

"Would you like a snack to take with you?" Mami asks, standing to match Homura.

"We just had dinner," Homura says, the ghost of a frown crossing her brow.

"Still!" Mami says cheerfully. "Ice cream? We have... Sabrina, do we still have the caramel fudge?"

"That won't be necessary," Homura says with a shake of her head. "I'm full. Thank you."

"If you're sure," Mami says.

You heave yourself to your feet. "Alright, then," you say. "See you around, Homura. Take care, OK?"

"I will," Homura says. She glances at Mami. "Thank you." She tugs gently at the ribbon on her wrist, which Mami allows to fall-

And she's gone. The noise of Mitakihara crashes back into you, colours released from the thrall of Homura's timestop. You imagine that even if you rushed to the window -now politely closed to a crack- she'd be well out of sight now. Mami smiles at you, warm and pleased and *buoyed* from Homura opening up.

You don't smile back.

You stalk towards her, closing the distance. Her eyes are glued to you as you close - and then you sweep her off her feet.

"You're perfect," you tell her after an interminable minute. "And don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise."

Are you blushing? You're pretty sure you're blushing with how hot your ears are. Mami definitely is, staring up at you with wide, wide eyes and breath coming short.

"U-um. Sorry, was that OK?" you ask.

"Y-yes!" Mami squeaks.

"OK, then," you say, relaxing and letting Mami back down on her feet. She slumps bonelessly, cuddling up against you. "Well, you are. You're beautiful and perfect."

"W-what brought this on?" Mami says, still a bit squeaky, but steady enough to nudge you towards the sofa.

"What, I can't tell you that?" you say. You oblige her insistent little nudge, crab-walking over to the sofa so that you don't have to let go of her. "You..."

You break off with a sheepish laugh that morphs into an oof when Mami practically throws herself at you.

"Well, now that I'm about to say it, it's rather..." You wave your free arm aimlessly in the air. "But it helped remind me how wonderful you are. You did the exact right thing for Homura, Mami. She *needed* that, that acceptance. You helped. You Made A Difference tonight and just, just- you did it out of nothing but concern for a friend."

"It was the right thing to do," Mami says, ducking her head.

"It was, and that doesn't detract from anything. But, but that's-" You suspect that your smile is bright enough to reflect off distant buildings. "In this world, you shine so brilliantly. You're, you're *you*. And I really, really like that. I really like *you*, though I kind of hope that was obvious before..."

"That's- that's good. I really like you, too," Mami murmurs, eyes huge. She trails off, and buries her head against your side, trying to burrow closer. She looks up at you and smiles at you like you're *everything*. "You bring joy to my life."

You catch the tail end of a thoughtful look on her face, beaten away by the simple happiness already there.

"That's funny. Because I was about to say the same thing. You make me happy." You soften your smile to something more inquisitive. "Something on your mind?"

"No, not really," Mami says, shaking her head.

"Well... I'd be happy to answer anything more if you want? Now that Homura's opened up about it..." you trail off, raising your eyebrows.

"Mm... maybe another time?" Mami asks. "I need time to digest these revelations first."

"OK," you agree readily. "I don't like keeping secrets... And it's a *relief* that this one's in the open, now."

"Mm." Mami nods, the curls of her hair brushing over your shirt with a soft rustle. "Actually... one question?"

"Mm?" you echo.

"There's... there's more secrets, right? And one of them is the one that... you were worried about telling me?" Mami asks, slow and careful.

"Yeah," you say. Unease prickles down your spine. "Why do you ask?"

"I just wanted to be sure," Mami says. "Morbid fascination of a sort?" She reaches up, curling her fingers gently through your hair.

"Oh," you say. You'd *promised*, but the thought still sits ill with you. It doesn't feel like this is the right time, and you're terrified of... *breaking* Mami again. "I... I did promise I'd tell you, if you wanted to know."

"I know," Mami murmurs. You twitch a little when her finger slides gently against the shell of your ear, exploring curiously. "I... maybe another time."

"Are you sure?" you ask.

"Are *you*?" Mami counters. She disengages a little, far enough to inspect your face. "It's... really eating you up, isn't it?"

"It's... complicated," you say after a moment. "I *want* to tell you. I don't like keeping secrets, least of all from you. But I'm *scared*."

Mami nods, solemn and serious. "And you're trying to figure out how and when to tell me?"

"Yeah," you say, biting your lip. "It's just... it's hard."

"Then alright," Mami says. She settles back against your side. "Tell me, when you figure it out."

"That simple?" You can't stop yourself from asking, poking at it like an itching scab. "What if I never figure it out?"

"It is, and you will," Mami says. "I trust you, Sabrina."

"Oh." What else can you say to that? "I... I won't let you down."

"I know," Mami says, and burrows closer against you. Absently, you find yourself toying with her hair, running your hand along glossy golden curls.

You stay like that for a while, accompanied by the steady *tick, tock* of the clock. Mami slowly slides down, migrating until her head is on your lap, your hand smoothing along her brow.

"I should do my homework," she mumbles at last, and rolls over to bury her face against your belly.

"That's not what doing homework looks like," you point out with a laugh.

Mami makes a sad, whining noise. "I'd have to get up."

You giggle, tugging on a hair drill. "Maaami."

"I know, I know," Mami huffs, and holds her hands out. "Pull me up!"

You do just that, and help her get set up for homework at the coffee table - and then you hesitate, humming tonelessly to yourself.

"What's on your mind?" Mami turns a smile on you, pen hovering over paper.

"I kind of want to check the IRCs again, but the computer is in the study," you say.

"Oh," Mami says. "You can borrow my laptop?"

"Ah, good idea," you say. "Thank you!"

"It's in my school bag," Mami notes, hopping to her feet and padding you over so that she can fetch you the laptop, setting it up beside her homework space before settling back in to get started. You nestle in beside her and let your fingers hover over the keyboard for a long moment, thinking.

No response.

Huh.

They *were* remarkably scared of you when you'd shown up earlier.

Hesitantly, you tap out another command.

*Kyuubey*? In an IRC? It is, apparently, more likely than you'd have thoug- wait. You click to display the member list, and relax. Ah. They named their *bot* Kyuubey. Which, OK, you can see that making sense. Which leaves...

Oh. Well, that's a bit more reassuring. Does Hatsumi have an irc app on her phone? Seems so, by the looks of it.

There. You feel Mami shift to look over, and she stiffens a second later.

"That's just their bot." You hurry to reassure her. "It makes a weird kind of sense."

"Oh," Mami says, relaxing and scanning the rest of the messages. "I suppose it does. Hmm... Out for a hunt. This would be about the right time."

"Yeah, it does, so for now\..." A click, a hop, and a tab to the right. *And* you check your email in another tab, since you'd given that to the nyantokanyaru group. Nothing there, fortunately.

You huff a soft laugh, leaning against Mami. She flashes you a quick smile, but doesn't comment, intent upon her homework.

There's a long pause in replies - you get the impression they're probably talking about it directly to each other. Which... you *did* just give them a lot to chew over, so you can't exactly blame them. You half-twist in place so that you can rest your chin on Mami's shoulder, peering at her homework.

"... are you analyzing architecture?" You blink at Mami's homework. There are a few *old* buildings you don't recognise on the print out, and she has her textbook open.

"Mmh! Art class." Mami agrees, smiling at you. She taps a finger on one of the pictures, some old church that menaces with spikes and high arched windows, the surroundings carefully hidden so as to minimize outside clues. "Gothic or gothic revival, do you think?"

"Ggggothic revival, I think?" you venture. "If only because it *looks* too new to be fifteen-hundreds? But I'm not sure."

"I thought so too," Mami says, beaming and noting it down before tipping her head just a little to kiss your cheek. "There. Thank you, Sabrina."

You duck your head, blushing, and luxuriate in Mami's presence. The computer catches your attention from the corner of your eye, a new message blinking on the screen.

> \[20:23:45] \<Ceridwen> You've given us a lot of food for thought.
> \[20:23:57] \<Ceridwen> Do you mind if we take a while to discuss it?
> \[20:24:11] \<Fireblade> Do you have an email we can contact you at?

You raise your eyes at the screen, and nod.

> \[20:24:38] \<GriefBeGone> sure, [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#86f5e7e4f4efe8e7a8f0e3e3a8ebeff2e7edefeee7f4e7c6e1ebe7efeaa8e5e9eb)
> \[20:24:47] \<GriefBeGone> and sure, I can check back tomorrow or the day after?

> \[20:24:56] \<Ceridwen> Whenever works for you!
> \[20:25:07] \<Whiterabbit> it's night for you in Japan, right?

> \[20:25:12] \<GriefBeGone> it is, yeah
> \[20:25:15] \<GriefBeGone> 8:30, not 10:30
> \[20:25:18] \<Whiterabbit> oh, sorry

You sign off from that group with a smile. That... went well, you think. It's hard to say, without being able to *see* them to gauge their reactions, but the fact that there *is* anything for them to discuss means, hopefully, good things. You nod to yourself, satisfied, and check the other IRC - no response there yet, not that you were expecting anything. Witch hunts take *time*.

The rest of the night is uneventful. Mami finishes her art homework, and starts in on some revision with your help before taking your showers and simply relaxing. You leave the laptop open, checking it from time to time, but mostly, you enjoy watching the television and simply... spending time with Mami, no pressing issues on your mind.

Finally, just as you're considering turning in for an early night, a new line appears on the screen.

> \[22:47:15] \<hatsumi> hey are you still here
> \[22:47:16] \<GriefBeGone> hey!
> \[22:47:22] \<GriefBeGone> is everything alright there?
> \[22:47:28] \<hatsumi> yeah, sorry, it's been a night
> \[22:47:35] \*\*\* YatanoKagami joined #nyantokanyaru
> \[22:47:38] \<YatanoKagami> good evening!
> \[22:47:39] \<GriefBeGone> hello!
> \[22:47:46] \<GriefBeGone> hope your hunting went well?
> \[22:47:51] \<YatanoKagami> It did, thank you
> \[22:47:57] \<YatanoKagami> We've bagged two witches today
> \[22:48:06] \<GriefBeGone> That's good to hear! Is this a good time to talk?​

Mami squirms over, practically sitting on your lap so that she can see the screen.

"Ah, the group from Kyushu," she says. "Kagoshima, I believe Homura said?"

"Yup!" you say, squinting at the screen. They haven't responde- ah, speak of the devil.

You glance around for Homura before nodding and paying proper attention to the screen.

> \[22:57:08] \<YatanoKagami> would it be possible to talk tomorrow afternoon instead?
> \[22:57:21] \<YatanoKagami> We're not trying to avoid you, and I apologise if it seems that way.
> \[22:57:29] \<YatanoKagami> It's just that you caught us at a bad time.
> \[22:57:34] \<GriefBeGone> sure, I'm fine with that
> \[22:57:38] \<GriefBeGone> when's good?
> \[22:57:42] \<GriefBeGone> And just to be clear
> \[22:57:51] \<GriefBeGone> I mean no offense, but you seem to be a bit skittish
> \[22:57:55] \<GriefBeGone> is something wrong?
> \[22:58:03] \<YatanoKagami> We're a small, quiet group
> \[22:58:15] \<YatanoKagami> But we've kept ourselves informed about the world.
> \[22:58:36] \<YatanoKagami> We understand that you mean well, but Grief controllers in particular tend to be volatile.
> \[22:58:40] \<YatanoKagami> We were worried, yes.
> \[22:58:56] \<GriefBeGone> I understand, I guess. But I really just want to help.​

Mami frowns, looking over your shoulder. "That's a touch concerning," she murmurs.

"Isn't it?" you agree. "But I don't want to press them too hard."

"It feels like..." Mami hums quietly. "It feels like they've gotten a very different impression of the world in general than we have. An information bubble?"

> \[22:59:02] \<YatanoKagami> And we're grateful!
> \[22:59:14] \<YatanoKagami> We just had some hopefully understandable trepidation at the beginning?
> \[22:59:16] \<GriefBeGone> I understand
> \[22:59:27] \<GriefBeGone> I'll leave you to rest, and come by tomorrow afternoon?
> \[22:59:33] \<GriefBeGone> do you prefer any particular time?
> \[22:59:38] \<YatanoKagami> After 1, perhaps?
> \[22:59:41] \<GriefBeGone> Ah, that's fine
> \[22:59:48] \<GriefBeGone> See you tomorrow, then!
> \[22:59:51] \<YatanoKagami> Until tomorrow
> \[22:59:54] \<hatsumi> good night

You huff a breath, signing out and sitting back.

"There," you say. "And hopefully they're more open tomorrow?"

Mami nods in agreement.

"I think that was the right thing to do," she says. "Don't force them - it's *especially* not going to work over the Internet."

"Yep," you say, and shift to deliberately sprawl belly-up over Mami's lap, legs kicking over the edge of the sofa.

Mami laughs, walking her hand through your hair. "You've had a busy day. Shall we turn in early today?"

"I think so," you say, twisting to prop yourself up on one elbow and grin at Mami. "An early night sounds *wonderful*."

"Mmm," Mami says, a glint of mischief in her eye. She shifts her arms under your body and stands, lifting you without effort.

Ah, magical girl strength.

You whoop and laugh, clinging to Mami as she carries you to bed, and finally, you settle down for the night, curled gently around Mami.

"Goodnight, Mami," you murmur.

"Goodnight, Sabrina," she responds, mumbling it into the hollow of your throat.

- [ ] The usual morning routine - Breakfast, Radio Mitakihara
  - [ ] Anything special to hit?
- [ ] What to do after? (One hour)

Word count limit: 150 words**

Spoiler: Locked in for next IRC session

  - [x] Check back in with #nyantokanyaru.
    - [x] Their reaction to you was a bit worrying. Is there someone other than Rionna going around ganking grief controllers or do grief controllers tend to be super territorial or something?
    - [x] Ask about their local politics. With a grief controller acting as a force multiplier for a Clear Seed, you might want to get one to them sooner rather than later so they can share it around.
    - [x] Also, Mitakihara has infinite cleansing and can accept refugees.
    - [x] Talk Walpy. You are assembling an army. Even if they don't want to fight, it'd be great to have a grief controller with a clear seed to staff the trauma ward.
    - [x] Ask if they know anything about the Iowa group. You're pretty sure they'll be gunning for you and you intend to do unto them before they do unto you.

*Daisuki*, not *aishiteru*. It's only been a few weeks, after all.

Also, minor retcon, editing Fireblade's mannerisms slightly in the last IRC segment. She capitalizes and punctuates!

You'll have one hour after sending everyone off to school, more or less.

# Unforeseen Consequences pt. 18

"Yeah. Let's do this," you nod, adrenaline fading slightly. This is *it*. This is *real*. You're going to go up against a giant, eldritch horror literally born of despair and suffering.

Mami takes Sayaka's bat, and slams it against the ground hard enough to crack ersatz concrete. She catches your eye with a small smile. "I'll teach you how to do this sometime; it took me a *long* time to learn on my own." Finishing, she takes a long step off the balcony, and you follow.

You instinctively land on your feet behind Mami, noting that Gertrud is still ignoring you. The moment that you touch the ground, however, the Witch whirls in place to face you in an impossible action entirely too light for something its size. A low, gurgling roar fills the air, thrumming against your skin and sending Mami's hair-drills flapping.

A crash, and the enormous couch the Witch had been perching on comes flying at you. Mami dives left, while you dive right. For a moment, your wings of corruption flare wide, boosting you further than you should go.

Mami dips into a curtsy at the Witch, muskets sliding out from under her skirt. You shake your head, slightly amused at her theatricality, before you're forced to dance out of the way of black tentacles emerging from the ground.

Gertrud leaps into the air, borne aloft on furiously flapping butterfly wings. Sharp cracks fill the air as Mami opens fire with the thicket of muskets surrounding her, snatching up one after another and firing with preternatural accuracy. Chunks fly from the Witch as each shot smashes home.

A furious buzzing alerts you, and you instinctively leap backwards as a conglomeration of flying Familiars dive bomb you. Your warhammer flicks around and punts the mass into the far wall, exploding in a spray of fluff. You don't see it, though, dodging as you are the viper-quick tentacles harrying you.

One finally snakes around your leg and whips you into the air, before slamming you against the wall. Despite having shattered concrete in the impact, you're barely dazed, and a second later, your wings snap out, slicing through the tentacle. You land, wings flaring wide to soften the landing, just in time to hear Mami call out, voice ringing like a clarion, "Tiro-"

"-FINALE!"

An enormous boom, more akin to a roll of thunder than any firearm, echoes through the chamber, and the Witch simply dies without ceremony, vanishing in a blaze of light.

Mami lands daintily on her feet, before spinning delicately to catch a teacup and saucer. She sips elegantly from the cup and winks at you, before turning to smile at Madoka and Sayaka, still watching from the balcony.

You have *no* idea where that cup came from.

A clacking noise marks Gertrud's Grief Seed falling to the ground not far from you, and the Barrier starts to waver, like a projection on a flapping cloth.

In your senses, you can *feel* the entire Barrier break up and fall *inwards* toward the Grief Seed; an ocean going down an enormous drain. You relinquish your control over your wings of Grief, and the Grief is similarly caught up in the flow, pouring into the Grief Seed.

The Barrier vanishes without fuss as Mami walks over to the fallen Grief Seed.

*Where did that cup go?*

"That was amazing, Mami, Sabrina!" Madoka exclaims.

"Yeah!" Sayaka pumps her fist in agreement.

"That might have been the fastest I've ever cleared a Witch," Mami declares. "You did very well, Sabrina! Are you *sure* this was your first hunt?"

You can sense a somewhat familiar presence, of Grief and magic, nearby.

**\[] no seriously what's up with that cup explain ex-plain EX-PLAIN!
\[] Good instincts, I guess?
\[] Gem cleaning time!
\[] Hey, Homura, I know you're there.
\[] Write-in**

Elsewhere.

"I want to learn the meaning of my life! This is my wish. This is my prayer. Fulfill it, Kyuubey!"

And here ends chapter one: Unforeseen Consequences.
Geddit? *Unforeseen*? Because the precog wasn't contracted yet. ... I'll see myself out.
Let the games... *begin*.

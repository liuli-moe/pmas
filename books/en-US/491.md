# On a Rail pt. 8

You *like* it when she talks like that. She was passionate and happy and *confident*, a far cry from the Mami you know and more like the Mami she wants to be.

You... you *do* like it, and you open your mouth to say so-

And you choke yourself off, fighting back the blush that's already making its way onto your face. Too soon. Too soon, when just *last night* she was sobbing into your arms because she was terrified you'd leave her. She... Whatever her feelings towards you, you don't want to pressure her.

Not that way, not in a way that could be taken as flirting.

"Sabrina?" Mami asks, peering up at you in concern.

You shake your head, grin blossoming on your face. It's genuine, no matter the direction of your thoughts, for all that you were going to do something probably ill-advised.

You're happy, even for that tiny flash of conviction.

"You're right, of course!" you say, beaming at her. "If my attacks don't have fantastic names, then why bother? I might as well be one of those poor, sad people who don't name their attacks at all!"

"Um..." Mami looks at you, pursing her lips. "But you *don't* name your attacks, Sabrina." Something like horror flashes across her face, her eyes widening as her expression crumples. "S-sorry, I-" She reaches for you, faltering mid-way. "I, sorry, I'm sorry-"

Your stomach plummets.

"No." You pull her into a hug, holding her close. "No, Mami. You're fine. It was just a joke, and I'm not offended. I'm not leaving you."

Mami shakes her head wordlessly, stiff as a board in your arms.

And this is why you're so reluctant to do... anything. You bite back a sigh.

First and foremost, she's your friend.

You stroke her back in slow, soothing circles as her shivering slows down. You repeat your reassurances, crooning into her ears, calming her down. Hopefully.

"S-sorry," Mami whispers, finally wrapping her arms around you. "I just-"

"I get it," you whisper. She's afraid. You form a seat out of inert Grief, sitting and pulling her down beside you without breaking the hug. "But here I am, and here I remain, yeah?"

You pull back far enough to cup her face with one hand, giving her a smile. "I'm not going anywhere. But... Mami, I *liked* it when you started lecturing me. I like it when you sass me back. OK? Leaving you over that is the *last* thing I would do."

Heh.

Not that way, not in a way that could be taken as flirting.

Mami nods weakly. Her hair brushes against your hand, featherlight touches. "A-alright," she whispers, exhaling shakily.

"Good," you say, smiling and pulling your hand back. "Now, may I clean your Soul Gem, Mami?" At her nod, you do just that, a flex of your willpower siphoning off the Grief and crushing it down immediately.

"OK," you say, giving Mami a quick squeeze to reassure her. "Yes, I'm one of those poor, sad people who *don't* name their attacks - my words, not yours. So it's a good thing I have dear Mami to help me with it, right?"

She nods, and if her smile's a little strained... Well, that's neither here nor there.

"Now, the problem is that I want to make sure that my attacks are worthy of the awesome names that you come up with for them," you say, ruffling her hair. Your other arm stays firmly around her waist, a constant reminder of your presence. "I... Well, I dunno. Is this really on par with something like Tiro Finale?"

Mami leans into your hand. "Um..." she says, giving the still glowing puddle of slag a look.

You run a quick calculation or two in your mind, considering how *much* energy your laser put out. It's *substantial*, to say the least.

Heh. Eat your heart out, Ramiel girl. What was her name again? Koizumi Sasami, right. Then again, she wasn't actually firing *lasers*, was she? You could see her beams. Your beams probably aren't visible save by the thermal bloom and subsequent re-radiation on visible wavelengths.

... And of course, your beams are utterly lethal. Starlight Breakers they're not.

"I... I suppose not," Mami says, finally. "You could still give it a name! How about, um..."

"How about 'Luce Eterna'? Light eternal," you suggest, smiling. "I'll save Luce Finale for something that *fits* the name."

"Ah," Mami says. "I like that name. I was going to suggest 'Prima Luce', but that's good!"

"Hmm... 'First Light'?" you ask. "I like it. Uh... I'll think over it for a bit?"

Mami's smile is wobbly, but genuine. "Alright," she says softly, leaning against your side.

"Good," you say. "Also, Mami, did I zone out at all while doing that?"

"Um... you were sort of focused for a second or two," Mami mumbles, burying her face against your shoulder. "But I don't believe you zoned out."

... huh. Interesting. It seems like this was... mundane enough to not warrant you going into a full trance?

Or something of the sort.

You grin. "Then I'd consider that way more successful than anticipated, It... well, I had more planned, but hey, that makes the other stuff unnecessary," you say. You turn a bright smile on Mami. "Well, I guess I should have asked you back home, but hey - are there any old projects that you might have had? With your ribbons, or something?"

Mami blinks. "Oh- I have some ideas, but wouldn't you rather work on your own ideas?" she says.

"Nah," you say, with a shake of your head. "I *had* more ideas, as I said, but well... frankly, what I just discovered makes it all obsolete." You fiddle with a few stray strands of hair, tucking it back behind your ear. "So... yeah. We have a little time to burn, right? And I'm not implying you couldn't do it yourself, but I'd just like to help and-"

You shake your head. "Sorry, I'm, babbling again, aren't I. I'm just excited, really."

Mami smiles a little. Stronger, more genuine. "W-well, I... did have some ideas. Um... I never did manage to make myself *fly* properly with my ribbons, and, um, I've been working on and off about a way being in more than one place at a time?"

... Does she mean what you think she means?

"Go on?" you prompt with a smile.

"Ah..." Mami says, straightening up a little. "The biggest problem with flying was that it was always a bit too expensive, and I could never really visualise a way to make the wings *work*."

You snicker, and wiggle your fingers at her in a vaguely magical gesture. "Well\~"

Mami smiles, dipping her head in acknowledgement.

"How about the other thing?" you ask. "Being in more than one place at a time? Actually, I remember you doing things in the kitchen from another room entirely, is it like that?"

"Um..." Mami says. "Maybe I could show you?"

"Sure," you say, beaming at her. You hop to your feet, offering Mami a hand and pulling her up to stand beside you.

"This will take a minute or two," Mami says. She takes a deep breath and holds out a hand, palm down. She frowns sharply in concentration, a veritable waterfall of golden ribbons starting to spill from the end of her sleeve. They practically shimmer, even to the naked eye.

Hm. Mami did say it would take a minute or two. You keep an eye on Mami, and her Soul Gem, simultaneously reaching out for Homura with your mind. "*Hey, Homura,*" you say.

"*Good morning, Sabrina,*" Homura responds, all but instantly. "*Is something wrong?*"

"*'morning, Homura, and no, not at all,*" you say, eyeing the ribbons pooling and twisting at Mami's feet. "*Just saying good morning to my friend! How was last night?*"

"*Last night was... fine,*" Homura allows, a faint hint of warmth creeping into her voice. "*Madoka is safe.*"

"*Great,*" you say. "\*And \*you?"

"*I am doing fine,*" she says after a moment of hesitation.

"*Good,*" you say, watching with interest as the ribbons surge upwards, beginning to take shape. "*Say, Mami and I are testing our powers now, particularly, ah, destructive attacks. If you want to, you can join us, or Sayaka when she comes along in a while?*"

There's a long pause, of Homura clearly thinking it over. "*I do not want Miki Sayaka to copy my powers.*"

You're about to respond when Mami finishes her work, the shapeless mass of ribbons coalescing into...

Bright, blonde drill hair, that same corset and perfectly ruffled dress and *huge,* adorable golden eyes and-

Barely past your knee.

Mami's made a *tiny, chibi version of herself.*

The real Mami's still frowning in concentration as the tiny doppelganger raises its equally tiny arm to wave at you. "This is what I've managed to do so far," she says through the mini-Mami. "I've had difficulty making the clone any larger; the ribbons destabilise if I lose concentration."

[Gaslighting](http://the-orbit.net/brutereason/2014/07/18/depression-and-self-gaslighting/) is an ugly, ugly thing. Also, do remember to get back to the name for the laser attack. ![:p](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Stick Out Tongue    :p")

# Power Up Pt. 19

*Everyone* puts you in the hotseat. Heck, after *that* particular little interjection, *everyone's* looking at you. Which, OK, fine, Kazumi has a point here, you're the one sitting on the broadest overview of the situation, probably, and should probably be the one making the decision. Still, *everyone* puts you in the hotseat.

"... if you're sure?" you say, glancing to Akane. There. Hotseat passed on.

"I think it would do much for mutual trust," Akane says, giving you a considering look, then turning her attention to her friends - Aoi, Akari, who refuses to meet her eyes, and a last, lingering look at Megu before returning to you. "It's time."

"To *outsiders*?" Akari mutters, downcast. "To *her*?"

Sayaka bristles, levelling a glare at her fellow bleunette. Mami's expression doesn't change, and maybe no one else would notice, but there's a certain degree of... irritation in her posture. You can't say you mind the defensiveness on your behalf, and you can't say that you're not a *little* offended, but well. You *are* a meddling outsider.

"They have already seen behind the curtain," Akane parries calmly, indicating the frozen backdrop of the Tokyo Council, and turns to address you. She hasn't risen from her position, still seated with her hands folded neatly on her lap, sleeves and train splayed out about her like a butterfly's wings. "You have seen the delicate peace of Tokyo. I have led to the best of my ability, but even so, cracks have crept in. We need- we *beg* that you help to keep our secrets, if not for our sake, then for that of peace. And perhaps..."

"Perhaps *what*?" Sayaka demands, folding her arms.

"Perhaps we might talk, Miss Miki." Akane pins Sayaka with a look, Sayaka almost rocking back at whatever she sees. She indicates the girls of the Council once more with an elegant wave of her hand. "We lead. We do not -*cannot*- bend to ask them for help, or risk shattering our strength and the Council itself. You are outsiders to Tokyo, and your biases are not to any one faction. Indulging your compatriot's questions, or indeed, any that you might have, would help us establish some transparency, as well as trust." She turns to Niko. "Please, Miss Kanna. Ask your questions."

Niko grins wolfishly, having wrangled free of Kazumi's confining embrace, a look crossing her face like, well, a wolf backing its prey against a cliff. *Hungry*, and eager.

"Karma isn't something you can just *control* like that," Niko says, her eyes boring into Akane with fever-bright curiosity. "Not without putting your own on the line. Because it makes sense, doesn't it? The only way to *affect* another soul is to *interact* with it, and therein change the outcome. If that's the case, then... You're not human."

Akane tilts her head curiously. "That is not a question, and it's something that is certainly up for debate, which is more and less than can be said for..." a lazy, expressive wave of a hand "... *normal* people, I suppose. I am myself, and no other."

"Hmph," Niko says, nodding decisively. "Sophistry, and you know it. You were *made*, weren't you?"

"Hey hey hey, what the heck?" Sayaka snaps, half-turning to frown at Niko. "You can't- you can't just say that."

"And you are *wrong*, Miss Kanna." It's Aoi who speaks, the answer hissed out between gritted teeth. She stands with fluid grace, radiating irritation in the set of her shoulders and the raise of her chin, staring down all of you, unafraid. "Akane was no more *made* than any of *you* were made by your parents."

"Eh, I think you're taking offense where you shouldn't," Niko says flippantly, neatly sidestepping an elbow from Kazumi and running into one from *Umika*. "Ow. It doesn't matter whether you were '*made*' or not. Definitely doesn't change whether you're a *person* or not, it just changes where and how you started. Miss Riko and Miss Shimada, correct?"

"Niko," you say, maybe a touch sharply. You probably *should* cut in here, shouldn't you? Just to keep your hosts from getting offended. "I... understand getting excited about figuring things out, and *I'm* interested in hearing where you're going, but Sayaka's right. We're here as guests, and, uh..." You gesture behind you. "Just... not everyone has the same perspective as you do, OK?"

Mami shoots you a swift, approving smile, tilting her head slightly. She'd have stepped in herself, but she's glad *you* did.

"Right, right," Niko says, frowning briefly. She glances from you, to Kazumi, then back to the Chiyoda girls. "... sorry if I've offended you. But - Miss Riko, and Miss Shimada, yes?"

Akane blinks, seemingly thrown by the jump in conversational directions. Megu and Aoi, in turn, both look uneasy, watching Niko warily, and Aoi in particular locks her hands at her sides with the kind of rigidity that comes from being so tense you can't even relax your shoulders.

"Yes...?" Akane says, trailing off.

"Body, magic..." Niko's attention moves from Aoi to Megu, and then to Akari. "... and *soul*. So what is *your* power, Miss Matsui? Are you a soul mage of some kind? I've never met a proper soul mage before."

You can see where Niko's going here, you think. Body, magic, and soul. Three things to comprise a magical girl, or something *similar* to a magical girl. Magic is easy, with the ethereal web dancing through the air between Megu and Akane and sparking heatless fire over your heads. Doubly so, because you *saw* the way Megu took the Grief cost of Akane's magic. Body... you're not sure why it's a single criterion on its own, but insofar as you can judge from appearances, Aoi *does* have the whole SCIENCE!™ theme going. And Niko, it would seem, thinks that Aoi provided that part.

Then again, Niko's right there, and the subject of your thoughts: Niko, who's more of a mad scientist than anyone you know of. Elsewhere and elsewhen, she would have headed and *succeeded* in one of the most dementedly ambitious magical science projects you've ever heard of, and relevantly, she doesn't have anything *remotely* resembling those aesthetics. She's making reasoned guesses, you suppose, which brings you to...

"Soul mage?" Akari says. Despite her earlier despondency, there's a glimmer of amusement in the dark gold of her eyes as she raises her head. "Oh no, nothing of the kind."

"So what I *want* to know is- whu?" It's Niko's turn to look flummoxed, jarred from her triumphant smugness.

"Merely a shinobi," Akari says with a hint of a smile, one mirrored by her friends - even Aoi, the faint smile cracking through her displeasure. "A very good one."

She doesn't *look* the part, with her pixie cut and the rich iridescence of her lamellar armour, but perhaps that's the point. It's clearly an injoke of some kind, anyway, but the best injokes are the ones with a kernel of truth to them.

"But-" Niko splutters. "No? Then- um-"

You all wait patiently, but she seems to have been completely thrown by that simple denial, the wind sucked out of her sails. Which leaves all of you standing in awkward silence for a moment, glancing between each other with the rest of the Tokyo delegates frozen behind you. Mika, in particular, looks thoughtful, her eyes resting on Akane.

"I, er, have a question, if I may?" you say, glancing at Niko, who's resorted to muttering to herself. "Not related to, er, the current line of questioning."

"Oh?" Akane says.

"Um... yeah, what was it about Sayaka that tripped you up?" you say. "It was something of a strain, right?"

"Ah, yes," Akane says. "An understandable concern. Miss Miki, I am currently speaking to you as a secondary body, correct? While your Soul Gem and body are elsewhere?"

"Uh... yeah?" Sayaka says.

"And you are yet able to use magic as a clone, are you not?" Akane says, turning back to you as Sayaka nods. "While I managed to ensnare Miss Miki, I did not expect the unusual nature of the task - magic is, after all, tied to the soul. And even if I had, it would have been the furthest I have reached with that particular magic. It is why..."

Akane frowns thoughtfully.

"You have another of your comrades listening in, correct?" she says. "In retrospect, I can sense her attention - well-concealed, and distant. I would likely have had trouble successfully snaring her as well."

"Ah. Right," you say, nodding slowly. And it *does*, you suppose, though a more suspicious person might still *wonder* about the slight ambiguity in her answer. Was it Sayaka's *soul* that's unusual?

... nah, Sayaka can't be an angel, right? She'd surely have told you by now if she were.

"I have two questions," Moe says. She's long since released her hold over the shadows, allowing them to fade and leaving her merely *metaphorically* shadowy in the darkness of her dress. "If we're speaking candidly - why us? Why now? Why would you reveal all of this to us?"

"Because the situation has become untenable," Akane says. "Your very presence here, while well-intentioned, has tipped the balance. Of course most people would want to access free Grief cleansing, and of course most would deny it to their enemies. Your generous offer of a Clear Seed, and in securing it, will delay the problem. And due to no error on either of our parts, you have seen further... behind the scenes, as it were, than any ever have. It only seems reasonable."

Moe purses her lips, exchanging a look with Shinobu. You'd take ten-to-one odds that they're talking to Yuki, back home in Fukushima. Which... well, you're consulting with Madoka and Hitomi back home, too, so you can't exactly blame them. Admittedly, not at this *exact* moment, but with Sayaka unfrozen, and Homura on the scene, they should be fine, if worried.

Right.

Which brings to mind a second thought: Sayaka can't be the first cloner Akane's ever snared. And you had Madoka and Hitomi listening on a *phone call* - surely someone's tried something similar, with their friends on call or even some kind of electronic bugs. Something *mundane*, and someone not *here*.

And for that matter, *Oriko*. She hadn't even noticed until after the fact, but... distance makes for an eminently reasonable explanation, you admit. Magical girls don't really move around all that much, on a geographic scale, and if Akane's focus is primarily on Tokyo, well.

"So... if you don't mind my asking, then," you say, picking the words with care. "What now? Do we simply resume the meeting, as if Imai had never brought up the topic? And... have they never attempted to circumvent this before?"

"Certainly they have," Toshimichi says. "My injunction is not merely against the occupants of this room - it applies to all within Tokyo, linked to those present. As to your earlier question, under ordinary circumstances, the answer would be yes. But these are extraordinary circumstances. Indeed, the... present circumstances will need to be resolved eventually. Until then, what would *you* do?"

"The options available to us seem rather limited," Mika observes, that seemingly ever-present, amused smile dancing on her lips.

"Nevertheless," Toshimichi says.

You get the impression that you -your whole group- are being evaluated somehow.

\=====​

Apologies for how late this update is - I'm having a little trouble getting back into the saddle of writing on a regular basis, as it were. Spending a couple months out of the zone will do that to you, I guess.

Also!

As with the last time: post the ideas you have about what's going on with Toshimichi Akane and the rest of her group - I'll be reading your posts, and it'll affect the next update. Well, probably, as long as the vote doesn't do something *too* weird. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

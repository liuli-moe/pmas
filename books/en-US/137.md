# Surface Tension pt. 14

You groan, and heave yourself to your feet, putting your half-eaten lunch aside. "Excuse me, I should go after her," you mutter. "*Yeah, I'm sure. I think I... pushed her too hard,*" you tell Mami.

"Oh... good luck, Sabrina," Madoka says, looking down and poking her fingers together.

"*Hmm,*" Mami replies thoughtfully.

You walk after Homura at a brisk clip, feet ringing on the tiled floor. "Homura, wait up!" you call.

To your mild surprise, she *does*, turning with brows furrowed.

She's only a little further down the corridor, nearly at the stairwell. "I..." you swallow. "I'm sorry. Sorry for pushing you like that, out of the blue. I should have known better."

Homura grimaces, but nods slowly.

You sigh. "How are you feeling right now?" you ask gently.

"I'm fine," she bites out.

"Homura, *please* let me help you," you plead. It's like pulling teeth, getting *anything* from the girl. "I... you can't just go on like this, pushing everyone away. This was... too far, and I'm sorry, but... *please*, Homura, tell me what's wrong."

She struggles with herself, expressions crossing her face lightning-quick - dismay, annoyance, fear, *longing*, and more you can't even begin to guess at. Finally, *finally*, she begins speaking, a quiet whisper. "I'm *scared*." Her hands are trembling, the slightest, barely visible quiver.

And maybe you can guess a little at that, from what she's said before.

Dammit, Homura.

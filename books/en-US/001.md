# Unforeseen Consequences pt. 1

Your head swims as you fade in and out of darkness. You retch miserably, bringing up nothing but bile as you struggle to recall-

You almost black out again, but a small hand stops you from tipping over. Weakly, you struggle to a kneeling position, meeting the horrified eyes of a girl who'd been passing by.

The girl has pink hair and eyes, and a soft, round face now scrunched into a worried look. She's wearing the uniform of a local school here: a cream coloured blouse trimmed out in black and red, with a bright red bow and black and white striped skirt. Near full leg stockings, or are those socks? Her name, even if you've never spoken to her before, is Kaname Madoka.

At Madoka's side is her blue haired, blue eyed friend: Miki Sayaka. She's dressed in the same uniform as Madoka, and flinching back from you a little: a little more cautious and a little more suspicious of you.

And riding on Madoka's shoulder... A little cat like creature that is very obviously not a cat. White fur with pink markings, weird appendages coming out of the ears and those odd gold hoops... Kyuubey, the Incubator.

You shake your head, trying to regain some control.

"-really out of it! What do we do?" Madoka's exclaiming.

"_If you make a contract with me, you could heal her!_" Kyuubey finishes in its syrupy sweet voice. You can hear it, you realize.

_You_ can hear it, you realize. You can _see_ it.

Your hand shoots out and snatches the little alien off Madoka's shoulder. Madoka flinches, and at her side, Sayaka bristles defensively, one hand coming up before halting, in an aborted attempt to ward you off.

"That..." You cough, before rasping out, "That won't be necessary."

Holding Kyuubey by the neck, you bring it to eye level. "Kyuubey. What is my potential?" you rasp, trying to focus on its face.

Kyuubey stares at you, its unblinking red gaze seeming to get larger and larger and swallowing up the world and
GM's note: No. I did not.
You retch again. Madoka's rubbing your back soothingly -when did she get there?- What were you doin- Right, Kyuubey. Wish. "Kyuubey? My potential?" you prompt again.

The alien is silent for a minute as Madoka reaches forward with a handkerchief to wipe your face. Glancing at her, you can nearly see the golden eyes framed with flowing pink hair... You blink when Kyuubey replies, and the image is gone. "_I can't tell. Your soul is... strange._" Its telepathic voice is monotone as it always is, but tinged with what you think is faint confusion.

"Do I have the potential to become a Puella Magi?" you demand sharply.

"_It is possible... but it may be risky for you,_" the Incubator informs you reluctantly, tail lashing vigorously.

You chuckle dryly. "I'm pretty sure I'm dying, here." As if on cue, you retch again, and this time, the bile comes out tinged red. You vaguely hear Madoka whimpering.

Hello, SV. So it seems that I've decided to throw my hat into the ring and trying a out a Quest.
There's a saying. Villains act, heroes _react_.
We have here a _tabula rasa_, a blank slate of a character for SV to control as you will. I invite you to use as much meta-knowledge and reasoning as you like; I will be treating her as an avatar of SV as guided by the votes and a mind state as given by the thread, in any case.
I've always hated that saying.
So. Fair warning. This is not going to be an easy Quest. Oriko is going to be a primary antagonist, for starters, and, well-

Well. Let's just say you'll find out as it goes, eh?

Fair's fair, though. Make a wish. I'll let nearly anything pass, save anything story ending: No pre- or post- cognition for you, no immunity thereof, no "I wish to always succeed", no "I wish for Oriko to drop dead", no Path to Victory for you. Just about anything else is fair game, though! You _can_ wish to 'never become a Witch', or to be able to turn Witches back into puella magi, and so forth, though! Oh, but no multi-clause lawyer wishes.

So make a wish, SV. Make a wish, and let's get this rolling.

(This _would_ be a picture of Oriko, but ~~I can't find one with her doing the Gendo pose. Which vaguely disappoints me, but she's not that popular, I guess. Shame.~~ while I have one now thanks to the amazing [@Krekian](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/2312/), I'm leaving Gendo!Mami here for historical purposes.)

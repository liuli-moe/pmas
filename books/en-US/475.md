# Anomalous Materials pt. 40

"Well, honestly?" you say, leaning back. Kyouko is *uncomfortably* close to you, that intense glare not leaving yours. "I might just end up flying Sayaka over here instead."

Kyouko snorts, rolling her eyes derisively. "And that will make things sooooo much better?"

"It makes things *different*," you counter. You fold your hands in your lap, placid and calm. This *is* familiar territory of sorts. "It's not the first time I've had to have difficult conversations with Mami, and it won't be the last. So I'll talk to Mami when I find the right time for it. Communicate."

You flash a confident grin. "It's what I do."

And honestly, it is. You communicate. You *facilitate* communication.

And hugs, but you'll admit those are mostly for Mami.

"Yeah, right," Kyouko sneers. She swings her legs on the spar, flicking them straight out, and uses the momentum to flip herself into a somersault to the roof below. "Because you can talk away every problem."

You shrug. "She might be upset," you agree, hopping off the spar to join Kyouko on the roof. "But as I said. I'll talk to her. Mami and I are friends, and she knows what's at stake."

"Yeah, good for you," Kyouko says, pacing to the edge of the roof and still staring over the rooftops. She crams more taffy into her mouth, chewing.

"There isn't going to be a fight," you say, folding your arms. "Not unless *you* start one." You rush on, bulldozing over Kyouko before she has a chance to snap back at you. "And let me be clear - I'm not accusing you. I'm just saying that I'll work my end out."

Kyouko glares out over the river, staring at Mitakihara.

"Fine," she grunts at last, jaw set hard. "I'm in. Tell me if you work something out."

"Kyouko..." you say, walking behind her. "Look, I get why you're so skeptical. But a lot's changed." You exhale, and decide to take a risk. "Mami's changed. And things have changed even more since I got here."

Kyouko snorts, and turns back to face you. "Right. Good f' her. Good f' you. That all?"

"I was going to ask you that, so... I guess so," you say, before a thought strikes you. You snap your finger. "Or, wait, yes, I never cleaned out that other Grief Seed, right?"

Chagrin melts away Kyouko's grimace for a moment, and she fumbles in her cassock dress to pull the Grief Seed out. "Right," she grumbles, looking away. "Thanks."

"Your Soul Gem, too?" you ask, already reaching out with your power. You can sense Bianca's Grief Seed somewhere on her person, and Jane's Seed - all but throbbing in your senses. You exhale.

Easy enough to fix.

With a flex of your *will*, you pull the Grief free - from Kyouko's Soul Gem, too, since she's reaching for it. Deep, bilious purple Grief swirls through the air, curling and eddying for a moment before you banish it to join the rest of your Grief cloud.

Hm. That's getting somewhat substantial again, but it's also an issue for another time.

Kyouko sighs, eyeing the now clean Soul Gem and the refreshed Grief Seed. "Thanks," she mutters again.

"Anytime," you say. A quick check of the time on your cellphone - you've got enough time to head back home and do a quick check with Mami's computer, you think. "See you later, Kyouko."

She sighs, and turns to head to the other side of the roof. "Later." With a smooth hop, she vaults over.

You look up at the sky, wings already blooming from your shoulders.

Back to Mitakihara. Back *home*.

You leap for the skies, wings pumping.

Heh. It's funny, how quickly Mami's apartment has become home for you. Admittedly, you don't know anything else, true. You can't help but wonder how things would have turned out if you'd gone with Homura, that first day. Probably a lot colder, a lot more focused. Perhaps you'd have made more progress with making Homura human again. But...

Home, now, is with Mami.

You coast to a landing on the roof, letting the wings fade. You hop down the stairs, a sliver of your attention all that's necessary to reform the Grief into your usual spheres for storage. Really, it's all but instinctual, like moving your limbs. You don't need to *think* about it.

Unlocking the door, you step inside and take your shoes off. You can't help but smile, footsteps slowing as the familiar, cosy surroundings envelop you, the same flowery, buttery yellow wallpaper and knickknacks arrayed along the shelves.

You walk over to the computer, tucked away in a corner, and boot it up. You'll look up that girl Homura mentioned - Kuroki Matsuko. You have a name, and presumably she's living around Mitakihara. That's enough of a starting point for you to try searching her up.

And so you do, keeping a sharp eye on the clock. Phone directory... Facebook that hasn't seen much use. Hm. Catholic school, it seems like. Seisen International. No listed address, though, but that's somewhere to start searching. She doesn't seem to have done anything particularly noteworthy, in terms of her academics or school competitions.

Well. Your eyes flick over to the clock again. Time to go.

You shut the computer down, putting your shoes back on and locking the door behind you. It only takes you minutes to climb the stairs to the roof, two at a time, and you take to the skies, headed for Mitakihara Middle School.

You know this route, now, and you know the school even from the air. You've only gone there for lunch every weekday, after all. With barely a rustle, you drop through the trees and land in the park outside the school, detransforming and strolling out to the school gates.

A few minutes to go until the bell rings, so you entertain yourself engaging in a staring contest with the truancy officer standing by the door. He frowns at you, but doesn't make any move to approach you.

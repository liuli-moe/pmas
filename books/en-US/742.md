# Lowlife pt. 8

Well. Damn.

Enemy action? Perhaps. Likely, even. There are rules and protocols, unspoken perhaps, but adhered to nevertheless. And when most magical girls are intensely territorial and capable of immense feats of destruction, the most basic rule is that *you call ahead*.

Iowa? They'd be early, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. It might, perhaps, fit their modus operandi, especially if they can leverage the storm into some kind of force multiplication.

The Soujos? Fire and ice, heat and cold - perfect for brewing a storm, if they had that scale of power.

A thousand thoughts sleet through your mind at once, spinning through the possibilities and counterplans. You don't know enough.

... on the bright side, if it's hostiles, you'd get to avoid aiding and abetting in Madoka's chair rampage.

"*Miss Mika? I, uh... well, thank you for the update, I really appreciate it. Could you wait for a second?*" you ask. "*I need to check with my friends.*"

"*'course,*" Mika says cheerily. "*Don't take too long now!*"

You look around at your friends, as much with your Grief and your senses as with your eyes. Homura's hanging back a step, her shoulders tense and back ruler-straight as she scans the crowds for trouble. Mami, by your side, is similarly alert, for all that she doesn't show it externally - you can feel the tension in her arm, looped through yours.

Sayaka's only just started to notice something, her eyes darting between you and Homura. Neither Madoka, Hitomi, nor Nagisa seem to have noticed anything, happily ogling clothes through the windows of the shops as you pass them.

"*Hey, everyone?*" You reach out by telepathy - *not* including Nagisa, of course. "*Something's up.*"

"*Ehh?*" Madoka blinks and stares at you. "*What's happening?*"

"*Hey, hey- Madoka, Nagisa doesn't know,*" Sayaka says urgently.

"*O-oh! Right!*" Madoka nods rapidly, pigtails bouncing, and faces forward again. Thankfully, Nagisa doesn't seem to have noticed, distracted as she is.

"*Uh... yeah, thanks, Sayaka,*" you say. "*It's nothing *immediately* urgent, I hope, but gimme a sec to pull Kyouko in.*"

Mami presses a quick kiss to your cheek, smiling, and releases your arm to sweep to the front of the group, drawing Madoka and Hitomi and Nagisa into a discussion about maybe sitting down to have some tea in a bit.

A second mental channel goes to Kyouko and Yuma. You can feel Homura's attention on you, razor-sharp and *ready*. You sneak her a quick, reassuring smile, despite the turmoil that gnaws at yourself. You don't *want* your time with your friends to be interrupted, but interrupted it has been.

"*Kyouko, Yuma, can you talk? We've got trouble,*" you say, mentally opening a *third* conversation at the same time. "*Oriko, Kirika - we've got a bit of trouble. Are you busy?*"

"*We just found this damn Witch,*" Kyouko grouses. "*Yuma, wave off. This better be good, Sabrina.*"

"*Not so busy that we can't talk,*" Oriko responds to you. "*What is it?*"

"*Right...*" you say, and merge the channels. Sayaka's eyes snap to you for a moment. Oriko's presence, undoubtedly. "*OK. Hello, everyone - I got a call from Nakano Mika over in Ishinomaki. She was wondering about the storm on top of us, and wanted to know if we'd picked up a weather mage at some point.*"

"*Nakano,*" Kyouko mutters.

"*Nakano, huh,*" Hitomi muses, slanting a look back at you.

"*The storm isn't natural?*" Homura asks sharply.

"*Apparently not,*" you say. You catch Homura's eye, holding her gaze for a second and shaking your head slightly. It's *not* Walpurgisnacht, as far as you know. "*Miss Mika couldn't tell me anything more from Ishinomaki, but she's volunteered to come and take a look.*"

You catch Sayaka frowning and slipping her hand in her pocket, palming a power gem - she hesitates for just a second before absorbing it.

"*That's good, right? She's... I suppose she must be an expert on this kind of thing?*" Madoka ventures. You give her a quick smile as you catch up to the front of the group, linking your arm with Mami's once more and ruffling Nagisa's hair as she scampers back over to you.

"*Do we know who might be responsible?*" Mami asks. "*I'm not aware of any groups near us that might have weather mages. Homura? Do you know of any?*"

"*Other than Miss Nakano, none near us,*" Homura says tightly.

"*Could be a new magical girl trying out her powers, could be hostile... we don't know,*" you say. "*I... mm. We're running blind here, and we have no idea of... where, why, and *who*. We need information.*"

"*Agreed,*" Mami says. "*So we need to find out. Miss Nakano volunteered to come over and take a look out of interest, right?*"

"*Right,*" you affirm. "*I wanted to get your opinions on whether to allow Miss Mika over before I confirmed it with her, and whether we should be alerting Fukushima and the Pleiades? Mutual defense pact and all.*"

"*Mutual freaking defense pact?*" Kyouko grumbles.

"*It might be nothing,*" Mami muses.

"*I believe it would be prudent to find some preliminary information, and then warn them if need be,*" Hitomi says. "*While the mutual defense pact suggests that we share and share alike, it wouldn't do to jump at shadows - it wouldn't do to alert them before we're sure that we have something to defend*against."

"*Yeah, I gotta agree,*" Sayaka says. "*And even if an entire army rolls in, we can hold on for long enough for them to get here.*"

"*Right. I guess that makes sense...*" you murmur. Mami smiles at you, squeezing your arm gently. "*And Miss Mika?*"

"*If she already expressed interest, I don't see why not?*" Mami offers.

"*She sounds nice,*" Madoka ventures.

"*She's smarter than anyone gives her credit for,*" Hitomi notes, giving you a look. "*Which I suspect is an impression that she deliberately cultivates. I think her opinion would be valuable.*"

Huh.

"*Fair enough,*" you say. "*So... are we all in agreement in asking Miss Mika to come over?*"

"*Agreed,*" Homura says.

"*Seconded,*" Mami says.

"*I don't see why not, so... yeah?*" Sayaka says. "*Madoka? Uh... Kyouko?*"

"*Why the fuck are you asking me?*" Kyouko grumbles.

"*I think so!*" Madoka says. "*We just need information, right? And we've got no way of checking, otherwise?*"

"*I could fly up there and take a look around,*" you muse. "*But I'm by no means a specialist, and I can sense magic, but I'm kind of pants at actually... noticing this kind of thing. Though... either way, we should probably have someone on overwatch when Miss Mika arrives?*"

"*I could take a look?*" Mami volunteers. "*I might be able to see if there's anything, from the roof, and I'd be able to watch for Miss Mika's arrival. Or... if you could carry me up into the storm, Sabrina?*"

"*Wait until Nakano arrives,*" Homura says, tone clipped. "*Multiple observation points can cover more ground.*"

"*That... yeah, that could work,*" you say. "*And... Sayaka, do you want to take a look?*"

"*I don't have the experience,*" Sayaka says. "*I *could*, but I'm in the same boat as you. Not sure how much I'll see.*"

"*Alright,*" you say, exhaling slowly. "*I'll let Miss Mika know, and we'll wait for her to arrive.*"

"*Gotcha,*" Sayaka says. "*... we gonna stick in the shopping centre in the meantime?*"

"*Well... Nagisa,*" you say. "*Plus, look. We don't *know* it's bad guys, and maybe it isn't - there's no reason to cancel the shopping trip until then, right? Let's have fun until then.*"

At the same time, you devote a sliver of attention to Oriko and Kirika alone. "*Hey, Oriko? Kirika? You've been quiet - you alright?*"

"*Oriko's looking at the clouds,*" Kirika reports quietly. "*She's focusing reaaaaal hard, and said she'd let you know if she found anything. I'm keeping an eye on her!*"

"*Ah, good call. Thanks, Kirika, thanks, Oriko,*" you say.

"*Yeah, I guess,*" Sayaka says. She closes her eyes, and then exhales hard, striding her way to the front of the group, turning to face you and planting her hands on her hips with a broad grin. "OK, OK. I like window shopping 's much as anyone else, but I wanna hit the music shop before the day's over. Anyone mind?"

"No, that sounds good!" Madoka says. Her smile is weak at first, then strengthens, determination leaking into the lines of her expression.

"Lead on, then," Mami says.

"This way, ladies!" Sayaka says, sticking her arm into the air and marching off like a tour guide.

You laugh, and follow.

"*Miss Mika?*" you say. "*If it isn't too much trouble, we'd like you to come over and have a look. And um... just in case there's trouble, we'll be backing you up, so let us know when you arrive?*"

"*Sounds like a fun time,*" Mika says. "*I'll be there in uh... hm. Twenty minutes, if I push it?*"

"*I'll cover any costs, if need be,*" you say.

"*Would be nice, since I'm not bringing the you-know-what with me,*" Mika says. "*Great, on my way, then! I'll let you know when I'm close.*"

"*Gotcha,*" you say. "*See you soon.*" You catch Homura's eye and nod a hair.

The lines around her mouth fail to move. They might as well be graven in stone, for all that her expression is nearly as blank as ever - but there's the faintest frown creasing her forehead, tension pulling at her lips and her shoulders. You can't blame her for that.

You hope it's nothing. Dear Madokami, you *hope* it's nothing. Some new magical girl testing out her powers for the first time. Even some strange Witch messing with the weather, as long as it's not Walpurgisnacht. Those are things you can deal with.

Plans whirl through your mind, fragments clicking together for an instance before coming apart. If you don't find hostiles... perhaps you should disperse the storm. Perhaps it's some effect cast *ahead* of an invasion - from Iowa, from Tokyo, from someone who's heard about your powers.

Either way, if it's magical, you don't want it there.

Leech the heat away, and the storm will die. Leech away the water, and you've effectively gotten rid of the storm. That's all you need to do, and neither is *strictly* out of your reach, with some effort. Or maybe Mika has the sheer power to simply take the storm and... *push* it somewhere else.

... that'd be kind of cool, you have to admit. Heat related puns aside.

"I've never been to the music store!" Nagisa says.

"Really? Well, there's a first time for everything, then," you say, smiling at her. "You'll enjoy it, I think!"

"Uh-huh!" Nagisa says happily.

"*Plenty* of good stuff there," Sayaka says. "And I'll see about picking up something for Kyousuke... though I guess he doesn't need it any more now that he's recovered?"

"I'm sure he'd appreciate the thought," Mami says. "Though... he plays the violin, does he not? Perhaps violin care supplies?"

"... hey, that could work!" Sayaka brightens a bit.

"He would have his own, wouldn't he?" Hitomi says.

"Yeah, but I bet he could always use more," Sayaka says, nodding firmly. "Great idea, Mami, I could look at it."

"Glad to help," Mami says with a smile.

The music store -or rather, *this* music store- is *huge*, a riot of colour, and unsurprisingly, noise. It's laid out in sections: to your left, musical instruments ranging from accordions to grand pianos, and to your right, rows and rows of records and CDs and whatnot, accompanied by headsets for listening.

"Arright, I'm headed over to the instruments to take a look first," Sayaka says with a grin.

"I wanna look at *everything*!" Nagisa declares, eyes huge.

"Well... why don't you decide where you want to go, and I'll come with you?" you offer.

"Uh..." Nagisa puts a finger to her lips, and then points at the instruments. "There?"

"Alright," you say, smiling. Mami squeezes your arm lightly, leaning lightly against you.

"I'll go over to the music section!" Madoka says.

"As will I, I think," Hitomi says, nodding thoughtfully.

"I'll go too," Homura murmurs.

"Oh!" Madoka beams at Homura. "Do you have anything you like to listen to, Homura?"

"... not really," Homura says.

"Well! We can't let that stand," Madoka declares. "I'm sure we can find you something that you'll like. Come on, Homura."

You snicker as Madoka leads Homura away, savouring this bit of calm. The calm before the storm, you'd say, except that the storm rather is ongoing.

Quick update, hopefully a quick decision... at least partially informed by me expecting to be busy tomorrow. ![:V](/styles/sv_smiles/xenforo/emot-v.gif ":V    :V")

I *think* I can update earlier next week, but I can't make promises.

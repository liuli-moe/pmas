# Office Complex pt. 16

Tuesday... Well, you really can't think of anything that might be an issue, bar one. The most important one, of course.

> - [12:53:15] \<GriefBeGone> Tuesday sounds tentatively fine with me, but let me check with Mami first?
> - [12:53:16] \<YatangoKagami> Of course.

You cock your eyebrow curiously at the screen even as you reach out by telepathy. *That* looks like someone who has something on her mind.

"*Hey, Mami?*" you say. "*Do you think you'd be free for a trip out to Kagoshima after school on Tuesday?*"

> - [12:53:38] \<TwoTails> did you contract in mitakihara?
> - [12:53:39] \<GriefBeGone> I did, why?
> - [12:53:40] \<TwoTails> just curious
> - [12:53:42] \<TwoTails> like, why Japan and all?

"*Mm, Sabrina? Oh, the IRC group?*" Mami asks. "*I'd like that. Are you thinking of bringing anyone else?*"

"*Nope, why?*" you ask, eyeing the screen. Interesting question to ask, you muse as you chew on the inside of your cheek. "*Did you have someone in mind?*"

"*Mm... Rather the opposite. It'd be nice to take a trip out, just the two of us,*" Mami says. She pauses. "*Is something wrong?*"

"*Nah, just got asked a bit of a weird question on the IRC,*" you say.

> - [12:54:09] \<GriefBeGone> ... I mean
> - [12:54:13] \<GriefBeGone> why *not* Japan?
> - [12:54:25] \<GriefBeGone> Overall it's a bit of a complicated story, but honestly
> - [12:54:46] \<GriefBeGone> The best answer I can give you *now* is that Mitakihara is my home.
> - [12:54:47] \<TwoTails> huh
> - [12:54:50] \<TwoTails> yeah, Iguess
> - [12:54:57] \<GriefBeGone> Why do you ask, anyway?

"*Mmm?*" Mami asks.

"*'Why Japan'?*" you quote. "*To which I answered, well - why *not* Japan?*"

Mami's laughter echoes over telepathy, warm and sweet. "*Well... I'm very glad that it *was* Japan, for what it's worth.*"

"*So am I,*" you tell her. "*So am I, Mami.*"

> - [12:56:23] \<YatanoKagami> Because Yugito is terribly rude
> - [12:56:33] \<TheWall> and I just got nodoka to sit on her
> - [12:56:34] \<GriefBeGone> ... er
> - [12:56:39] \<GriefBeGone> Weren't they fighting?
> - [12:56:47] \<GriefBeGone> TwoTails seemed a bit irritated earlier.
> - [12:56:48] \<TheWall> nsh
> - [12:57:00] \<TheWall> just irritated with nodoka embarassing her all the time
> - [12:57:00] \<GriefBeGone> ...
> - [12:57:03] \<GriefBeGone> Fair enough.

"*I'll leave you to it?*" Mami says, affection in her voice.

"*I'll see you soon,*" you murmur in response.

"*See you soon,*" Mami echoes, and ends the connection. You sigh, and smile to yourself, because even if you have to stop talking to Mami *now*, you'll see her again soon.

> - [12:57:51] \<GriefBeGone> Anyway
> - [12:58:01] \<GriefBeGone> I just realised that I never actually confirmed:
> - [12:58:16] \<GriefBeGone> Yeah, Mami's fine with Tuesday, so shall we make it official?
> - [12:58:27] \<GriefBeGone> Tuesday, at... let's say about four?
> - [12:58:31] \<YatanoKagami> That would be fine.
> - [12:58:31] \<GriefBeGone> Also
> - [12:58:34] \<GriefBeGone> I gotta ask
> - [12:58:49] \<GriefBeGone> Did you literally get Hatsumi to sit on TwoTails?
> - [12:58:52] \<GriefBeGone> If so, uh

> - [12:58:53] \<TwoTails> hi
> - [12:58:55] \<TwoTails> um, yes

> - [12:59:00] \<GriefBeGone> Well... hi!
> - [12:59:05] \<GriefBeGone> I hope you're well?
> - [12:59:07] \<TwoTails> yeah, just
> - [12:59:17] \<GriefBeGone> Ah, gotcha.

There's a gentle 'please go away' if you've ever seen one. Which... well, fair enough. They still seem kind of scared of you, which is something you'll dig into it gently, maybe. *Gently* being a key word here. Hm. Still, your presence alone is enough to make the awkwardness all but bleed out of the screen, but you'll *hopefully* sort it out when you get to meet her face-to-face, *and* it's not as if you don't have other things to do right now.

Still, you've got one last question to ask, you think, before you do hop off... and it's not as if you can't multitask.

Oriko and Kirika first.

"*Oriko, Kirika? Got a moment?*" you call softly.

> - [12:59:34] \<GriefBeGone> Well... just one question?
> - [12:59:35] \<YatanoKagami> Yes?
> - [12:59:52] \<GriefBeGone> Do you know anything about what the Tokyo Council are like, or if they're friendly?
> - [12:59:55] \<YatanoKagami> Only by reputation.
> - [13:00:18] \<TheWall> weeee're sort of as far away from them as possible while being still part of japan
> - [13:00:25] \<YatanoKagami> We *are* rather far away from Tokyo.
> - [13:00:27] \<GriefBeGone> That's fair!
> - [13:00:33] \<GriefBeGone> Just thought I'd ask, in case.
> - [13:00:38] \<YatanoKagami> Though... Nodoka?

"*Good afternoon, Sabrina,*" Oriko says. "*How are you?*"

"*I'm good!*" you say. "*You? And Kirika?*"

"*Quite well, thank you,*" she says. "*And Kirik-*"

"*Hiya!*" Kirika chirps. "*I'm good too\~*"

"*I should hope so,*" Oriko says, sounding amused. "*The trackers have arrived, by the by, and we're... ready for you to set them up at your convenience.*"

"*Eager, even!*" Kirika says happily. "*I wanna take Oriko out on a proper daaaate.*"

"*Geh,*" you say with a frown. "*Right. Hm. Ugh, I should have planned this better. I'll see what I can do. Homura and Sayaka will probably want to be there... Hitomi, too. But today after school... yeah. Yeah. I can't give you anything firm, but I'll do my best?*"

"*Understandable,*" Oriko says. "*We'll eagerly await your word on that, then.*"

"*Yeah, I'll do my best,*" you repeat. "*Sorry 'bout that, I should be more on the ball about this kind of thing.*"

"*Perfectly understandable,*" Oriko says.

> - [13:00:50] \<TwoTails> it's how I know about the whole grief controller thing
> - [13:00:57] \<TwoTails> I heard they come dwn hard on us?
> - [13:01:01] \<TwoTails> but yeah that's it
> - [13:01:06] \<TwoTails> heard it from a friend
> - [13:01:08] \<TheWall> *hugs*
> - [13:01:12] \<GriefBeGone> ah. Yeah, I see.
> - [13:01:14] \<GriefBeGone> Well...
> - [13:01:24] \<GriefBeGone> So I'll actually be meeting them this weekend.
> - [13:01:37] \<GriefBeGone> If you want, I'd be ask anything on your behalf?
> - [13:01:39] \<TwoTails> no! nonono
> - [13:01:48] \<TwoTails> I just want to be left alone
> - [13:01:52] \<GriefBeGone> That's fine too!
> - [13:02:02] \<GriefBeGone> But I did mean just *questions*, just in case?

You tug at your hair, thinking, and then frown and start trying to comb it back into place with your fingers. Honestly, the way it sounds, it sounds like the nyantokanyaru crew have been burned before, but it's a story they're unlikely to share right off the bat.

"*Anyway, so, I wanted to check in on you guys,*" you say, shaking your head. "*You particularly, Oriko, how's your Soul doing?*"

"*... settled, I think, after my epiphany,*" Oriko says. You can hear the tenderness in her voice.

"*I'm happy for you,*" you tell her sincerely, smiling. Oriko's devotion to Kirika, and vice-versa, is honestly a spot of pure *good* that they bring to the world despite their rocky start with you.

And as for *other* rocky starts... A graceful retreat from the Kagoshima girls' IRC is in order, you think.

> - [13:02:25] \<GriefBeGone> I can't argue with that.
> - [13:02:36] \<GriefBeGone> Still, if you change your mind, please feel free to let me know.

"*Thank you,*" Oriko says gravely. "*It wouldn't have happened without you.*"

"*I'm glad to have helped,*" you say, equally serious as you sign off the IRC, leaning back in your chair with a sigh and an amused smirk for the ceiling. "*Seriously. You two are good people. Kirika, get the squirt bottle.*"

"*Oh, I don't need it right now\~*" Kirika purrs.

"*Not gonna ask,*" you say, toying with the string of your necklace - the necklace Mami made for you. "*So, mushy *feelings* aside, I had some news about Tokyo and Iowa to update you about? Also, real quick before I forget - Oriko, you predicted the Soujus in on Monday, right? Most likely?*"

"*I... did, yes,*" Oriko says. "*And we would be glad to hear an update.*"

"*Alright! So...*" While you tell Oriko about Tokyo and Iowa, you take the opportunity to sign into milesgloriosus.

Ah, the sweet whimsy of Internet Arguments, capital letters intended. Or Internet Discussions, maybe. Especially when they aren't half-terrified of you, which is... really a nice change. You vaguely wonder about introducing the two groups to each other, but then again, language barrier.

"*... so yeah,*" you say, finishing your spiel about Tokyo and Iowa. You'd left out speculations that Kyuubey's the one feeding Iowa information, of course - and the fact that you're planning a strike. You're not sure whether Kyuubey's always listening, but there's no reason to make things *easy* for it. "*So that's about where I am now.*"

"*It sounds like good progress,*" Oriko says, her next words hesitant and cautious. "*Iowa is... concerning.*"

"*Oh?*" you say. "*... huh.*"

Oriko had never mentioned Iowa as a threat, back when she had her clairvoyance.

"*Indeed,*" Oriko says.

It's always possible that you were always going to have handled Iowa, of course, but it *is* a little disconcerting, now that Oriko brought it up.

You fidget with the string your necklace as you think. It *could* just be the fact that you apparently lack ontological inertia in Oriko's visions, and the distortion of your actions brought Iowa down on you. *And* you have to admit you're sort of curious about the necklace - Mami said that it wasn't finished, that she was going to practice the enchantment, *and* she's definitely been doing her best to keep it a secret from you.

You have to admit it's quite cute, not that you need another reason to find Mami absolutely adorable aaaand you've drifted well off topic.

Hm.

It's perhaps even *likely* that Oriko never foresaw you heading off to deal with Iowa, even, and it *does* seem like the kind of threat you'd have been incentivized to handle *before* they arrived in Mitakihara.

"*... we should, perhaps, converse in person sooner than later,*" Oriko suggests quietly. "*I'm not asking for action on the trackers right this moment, nor that you visit today - we do know that Iowa isn't due to arrive just yet.*"

"*Yeah,*" you say with a frown. Really, the key thing here is perhaps that Oriko doesn't know of your plans, and you can't tell her over telepathy.

Alright, so: For the record, I'm not going back-to-back IRC updates in the future without heavy timeskipping. I *thought* I could make this work, but I overestimated myself. I'm not writing a script fic and these are damned near impossible to write as something other than a script-fic.
